  ["Hamilton holds off Verstappen for tactically brilliant win at Bahrain GP","['Seven-times champion and Mercedes pull off strategic coup', 'Verstappen and Red Bull settle for second after securing pole']","['With his victory at the Bahrain Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton delivered an emphatic and salutary reminder that if Max Verstappen is to wrest the title from the champion’s grasp he will be fought every inch of the way.', 'Formula One moreover could not have asked for a more spectacular, gripping finale to the season-opening race than the deciding laps at the Sakhir circuit. Hamilton’s win for Mercedes over Red Bull’s Verstappen was as unexpected as it was enthralling and it was the fight the sport had been waiting for.', 'The new season had promised a potential contest between the 23-year-old Verstappen, for the first time in his career in machinery that can challenge for the title, and the 36-year-old Hamilton, attempting to take his eighth championship.', 'It was a mouthwatering prospect and the pair duly delivered in a climax that was impossible to predict until the chequered flag flew. When ultimately Hamilton and Mercedes had taken one of their most unlikely wins given the form book going into the race, the scale of the achievement was clear as the team celebrated almost as if they had won the title.', 'The pair vied for the lead right across the final six laps, Hamilton in front and Verstappen charging. For brief seconds the Dutchman took the lead only for the highest drama to play out at high speed.', 'The Red Bull driver had the place but had to allow Hamilton to take it back as he had gone off the track to make the move, against the rules which are hard and fast in this scenario. Verstappen was left to rue not quite calling it to perfection after a race he had, until that point, executed with inch-perfect precision.', '“The pressure was immense.” Hamilton said. “He is a fantastic driver and they have the quicker car. That was one of the hardest races I have had for a while. We had such a great fight here and they are going to come back with a vengeance in the next race.”', 'The victory was clearly of immense satisfaction to the world champion, coming as it did with Mercedes under the cosh against Red Bull who had been faster all weekend, quickest across practice and with a clear pace advantage in qualifying. Yet when it mattered – as they have done so many times in the past – Mercedes and Hamilton were able to find another level. The team has been superlative operationally in winning the past seven drivers’ and constructors’ championships and they once again delivered at the Sakhir circuit. They could not match the Red Bull for pace but pulled off a coup.', 'Mercedes had done all they could with an alternate tyre strategy to give Hamilton a shot at Verstappen while Red Bull held their nerve and stuck to their own plan.', 'The two drivers were in a race of their own out front and a cat-and-mouse series of pit stops ensued but after both had stopped twice Verstappen emerged eight seconds behind Hamilton, the world champion leading with 16 laps remaining but with tyres that he had already run for 10 laps.', 'Red Bull had brought Verstappen in on lap 40 for his final stop and it was a straight fight for the win. He set about the task and duly flew, catching the champion on lap 50. Two laps later he was on his gearbox as Hamilton’s worn tyres told, and the hard but fair racing was unmissable. The British driver defended stoutly but Verstappen passed him on lap 53 at the outside of turn four only to edge just wide putting all four wheels off the track. A tiny margin but enough to ultimately cost him the race. A reminder also that with passing in these cars so hard, the track position Mercedes had opted for proved the better option.', 'Verstappen had three laps to try again but his tyres had passed their best, he could not get close enough and Hamilton showed all his experience to hold the lead and take the victory by only seven-tenths of a second.', 'It is now 30 years since his father first raced and Mick Schumacher of the Haas team, the 22 year-old son of seven-time world champion Michael, had a spin early in the race on his F1 debut but recovered to finish in 16th. The double world champion Fernando Alonso, in his return to F1 after a two-year absence, had to retire with brake problems on lap 34.', 'Hamilton’s teammate Valtteri Bottas was in third and Lando Norris was an excellent fourth for McLaren. Sergio Pérez did well to recover his Red Bull to finish fifth having started at the back after a mechanical problem on the formation lap.', 'The seven-times world champion Hamilton knows he is up against it this season and securing every point may prove vital in a title fight that could go to the wire. There are 22 more races between now and December and if this is what the season holds in store Formula One has the makings of classic championship fight on its hands.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-03-28",18.2,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae01c6d13b423c4e4c6228a1fe6b47cd3dc4120/342_0_5130_3078/master/5130.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=3b1bd33239995cd93fe79f6c8a11215a","Lewis Hamilton embraces his Mercedes team after sealing a stunning win at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

With Max Verstappen topping both sessions, the reigning world champion, Lewis Hamilton, and his Mercedes team had to admit that as things stand they are simply unable to match their rivals.', 'Hamilton, attempting to take his eighth world championship this season, accepted that he and Mercedes, having dominated F1 since 2014, were now on the back foot. “It wasn’t where we wanted,” he said. “This weekend it is looking better but not perfect. We still have a hill to climb but we are staying positive.”', 'The British driver again highlighted the unstable nature of the car that has been evident in the Mercedes since testing. “We thought Red Bull would be as fast as they are,” he said. “We know they are leading at the moment, we will work away tonight and try and find a way.”', 'In the morning running, contested under atypical daytime conditions, Red Bull already appeared to have carried their form from testing into the first weekend of this 23-race season. Verstappen was quickest, almost three-tenths up on the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, while Hamilton was almost half a second back from the Red Bull in fourth, while McLaren’s Lando Norris an impressive third.', 'In the evening session, taking place in the conditions under floodlights representative of the race, Red Bull – who had headed the times in pre-season testing – proved their package is genuinely as strong as it had been hoped. Verstappen put in a time of 1min 30.847sec, over half a second up on his previous best and enough to leave Hamilton in third, two-tenths back. Norris and McLaren, who finished third in the constructors’ championship last season, will take heart from their strong showing, the British driver claiming second only a 10th of a second down on Verstappen.', 'Having already pronounced testing the best of his career, Verstappen retained his cautious optimism. “It’s been a good day,” he said. “With the heat, not easy to find a really good balance around the whole lap but it was a positive day. Now we have to show what we can do in qualifying.”', 'Mercedes’ team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted that the best scenario for his team at this point was just to be able to match Red Bull’s pace. “From what I’ve seen and what I hope is that we can have a really tough fight; it’s what the fans want to see and what we would like to have,” he said. “I think if we are behind, then we just need to catch up and do a good job. If we’re just about on the same pace – which I would consider today maybe as the best possible scenario for us – then we’re up for the fight with another great team.”', 'In their favour on long runs, simulating race pace, Mercedes did appear to be on a par with Red Bull.', 'Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times champion Michael, put in a solid performance in his debut as an F1 driver. In an uncompetitive Haas, the German was 18th in the evening, two spots in front of teammate Nikita Mazepin and Williams’ Nicholas Latifi in 19th.', 'Fernando Alonso, returning after a two-season absence, was in 15th for Alpine, four places down on his teammate Esteban Ocon.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-03-26",18.03,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dca70bb704bd45c04b08ded59b0d5a746435ee2a/0_130_3911_2346/master/3911.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=b54ed644db23194d02d851279c34d0b1","Max Verstappen during evening practice.

  ["Brundle and Hill expect Verstappen to challenge Hamilton for F1 title","['Former drivers impressed by Red Bull in winter testing', 'Brundle: ‘Max looks as lean and as mean as I have seen him’']","['Martin Brundle believes Lewis Hamilton is going to face a strong challenge from Red Bull for the Formula One world championship this season. His views were echoed by the former world champion Damon Hill, who insists Hamilton will relish a fight with his chief rival Max Verstappen.', 'The season begins this Sunday at the Bahrain Grand Prix and Hamilton is attempting to take a record eighth title having won six in the past seven years. His Mercedes team have dominated the sport since 2014 and were all but untouchable last season, although they have looked vulnerable in winter testing this year.', 'In contrast, Red Bull appear to have gone from strength to strength over the winter and were quickest in testing after displaying formidable reliability with the experienced Mexican Sergio Pérez alongside Verstappen in an outstanding driver lineup.', '“They have obviously found something with their car, they had a great test,” said Brundle, who took part in 165 races during his F1 career. “Max looks as lean and as mean as I have seen him, Sergio looks relaxed and comfortable, they had a wonderful test. Unless Mercedes were carrying heavy fuel with the engine on a very low mode and they were having a laugh with us all, it does appear to be game on with Red Bull.”', 'Mercedes lost track time in testing with mechanical issues and were off the pace, concerned at a lack of rear grip, while Hamilton made some highly uncharacteristic errors.', '“They had one of those tests where if it could go wrong it did go wrong,” Brundle said. “The sight of Lewis standing beside a stricken car in a gravel trap, you have to do a double take, when did we last see that happen? Or Lewis spinning on cold tyres coming into the pit straight? They just had one of these tests and I do think they have work to do, it did not go well.”', 'Hill, who won his title with Williams in 1996, agreed but believes Hamilton will only enjoy the motivation of a tough fight.', '“Lewis might be a little bit concerned about how Mercedes’ test went,” he said. “They have shown a little bit of vulnerability they didn’t want to show but he is a big boy and he will be as committed as ever. It might be more difficult but that won’t be off-putting for Lewis, he won’t mind having a fight. If it is a fight with Max he will relish that.', '“More than any season I can think of for quite a while it looks like there is a change of form. My hopes are up for a much tighter championship.”', 'Hamilton said he could not find the car’s sweet spot and the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has conceded his team are struggling to get to grips with the characteristics of the W12. “The car was a bit toxic to drive and fairly unstable, especially with the crosswind,” Wolff said.', '“It seems like we have a little diva, like the car from two years ago, that we haven’t really understood yet. The fact we only had a few days of testing certainly didn’t help. We haven’t yet understood the car the way we want to.”', 'Red Bull have not been in contention for a title since they last won the championship in 2013. Verstappen has returned race wins but the team have often been trying to catch up to Mercedes across a season. This year they look to be strong out of the blocks but Verstappen remains cautious until the real form is displayed in qualifying in Bahrain. “I see every season as a new opportunity to beat them, but we would be stupid to expect that fight to be easy and look at testing and think we are ahead,” he said.', 'Brundle is convinced Red Bull will have lost none of the competitive edge if they are in a close fight this season. “They can match Mercedes operationally because they are a mighty team,” he said. “If they have reliability, particularly from the power unit, I have no doubt that Red Bull know how to deliver a championship campaign.”', 'Hamilton has said he was happier Mercedes encountered issues in testing rather than when the season begins and remains confident his team will step up. Mercedes have been operating at a remarkably high level for the past seven years and Brundle concluded that Red Bull and Verstappen would have to be at the very top of their game to prevent Hamilton successfully defending his title.', '“If Lewis is happy and focused and with the might of Mercedes that is still the combo to beat,” he said. “Max would have to make sure he makes no mistakes because Lewis very rarely makes a mistake. Red Bull will have to hook everything up to beat them.”', 'Damon Hill and Martin Brundle are part of the Sky Sports F1 team.

Hamilton is attempting to take a record eighth title this year but has in the past fended off accusations that his success has been attributable to being in the best car. Here was unequivocal evidence against that suggestion, he said.', '“There are always opportunities to prove people wrong and today is definitely one of them,” he said. “There have been many in the past and I hope there are many in the future to be able to show what I was able to do today. We don’t have the fastest car at the moment, that’s all good for me. I don’t mind having to pull out extra in order to make the difference.”', 'Verstappen definitively had the quickest car over the weekend but Mercedes had the more successful strategy while Hamilton was able to nurse his worn tyres at the end, holding off the Red Bull after high drama when Verstappen took the lead only to have to hand it back having gone off track to do so.', 'It was enthralling racing and suggests a real battle between the pair is on the cards this season. The British driver was revelling in the prospect.', '“I loved every minute of it,” he said. “I am super happy for the fans that they are excited, this is something they have wanted for a long time. It’s only one race, we don’t know what the future holds. With the pace they have they could be ahead a lot more but we are going to work as hard as we can to stay close in this battle and I hope for a lot more races with Max.

Formula One formally announced the decision on Wednesday and confirmed it will be replaced on the calendar over the weekend of 12-13 June by the Turkish Grand Prix in Istanbul.', 'In an official statement said F1 said: “We are grateful for the efforts of the promoter and the authorities in Canada in the past few weeks to try and make the race happen and we are pleased to announce a two-year extension to our partnership with the Canadian Grand Prix.', '“We will work with the promoter to ensure those with tickets from [the] 2020 and 2021 races get the options of a refund or to transfer their tickets to next year’s race and look forward to racing in Canada in 2022.”', 'The race in Montreal has been expected to be called off for some time.

  ["F1 to bring in new testing to curb use of ‘bendy’ rear wings","['Static tests and on-board cameras will be in use from 15 June', 'Lewis Hamilton has questioned advantage gained by Red Bull']","['Formula One is to introduce new tests to ensure teams are not breaking the rules by using flexible rear wings. The issue was raised by Lewis Hamilton during the Spanish Grand Prix, where he questioned the advantage Red Bull may have gained from using what he called a “bendy” rear wing.', 'What are described as “moveable aerodynamic parts” have long been banned. However, teams always attempt to push the boundaries of these rules and wings that could flex under load may reduce drag on straights, increasing straight-line speed. After qualifying in Spain where he took pole, Hamilton suggested Red Bull were managing to get round the rigorous tests on movement of wings when the cars are stationary.', '“The Red Bulls are really fast on the straights,” he said. “They have this bendy wing on the back of their car which they put on today and they gained at least three tenths.”', 'The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, denied any infringement, stating their wing had passed all the rigidity tests required by the FIA. However, it is understood the FIA has now written to the teams warning it had observed some cars had passed static tests but may have demonstrated wing movement while in motion.', 'The governing body has told the teams it will introduce new static tests from 15 June. It will also then use on-board cameras to monitor the wings while in motion, with markings required to enable observation of movement.', 'Nikolas Tombazis, the FIA head of single seaters, wrote to the teams and insisted the introduction of new tests mid-season was necessary because of fears that wing movement could be being used to improve aerodynamic performance. “We will be looking out for any anomalous behaviour of the deformation of the rear wing,” he said.', 'The teams have been given a month before the new tests and monitoring system come in to allow them to enact any changes necessary. They will be able to use their current designs for the next three meetings: next week in Monaco, followed by Azerbaijan and potentially Turkey.', 'The race in Istanbul scheduled for 13 June remains in doubt, however. It was only recently added to the calendar to replace the cancelled Canadian GP, but with Turkey on the red list for travel from the UK it seems increasingly unlikely to go ahead. F1 is expected to make an announcement on Friday regarding the fate of the Turkish GP. There is potential that the French GP will be moved forward by two weeks to replace Turkey and then a second race in Austria added to take France’s original slot.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-05-12",17.11,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e08902c87e6a85fab2ee1d55235c8568776e654a/0_102_4506_2704/master/4506.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7b194f0a7ca30f3ccf1dd3b423b7e484","Max Verstappen’s Red Bull.

With Naomi Osaka drawing attention to mental-health issues around professional sport, Norris voiced his concern before this weekend’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a meeting that forms part of the longest season in F1 history.', 'The McLaren driver is enjoying a hugely competitive season and is currently third in the drivers’ championship. He and McLaren may be riding high but Norris was moved to highlight his disquiet over the demands of a 23-race season by Osaka’s withdrawal from the French Open.', 'Last year the 21-year-old revealed that he had hidden his struggles with anxiety and nerves during his debut F1 season in 2019 and that he sought help to deal with it. “We don’t talk about mental health as much as we should – and we really should,” said Norris, echoing Lewis Hamilton’s remarks on Thursday praising Osaka for bringing the issue to the fore.', '“I am sorry she is going through such things,” he said. “I have the utmost respect for her in coming out and saying these things and taking the action she has, putting herself first which is most important. I feel like I did struggle a lot but I am better now, I am in a much better place than I was.”', 'On Friday the Singapore GP was cancelled because of coronavirus restrictions but F1 is confident it has options to replace it. The sport still hopes, Covid-permitting, to hold 23 races, presenting a punishing schedule. There are currently four triple-headers, including three sets with only one week off between each, amounting to nine meetings in 11 weeks.', 'Norris had concerns for engineers and mechanics who work long hours across a race week, believing that F1 may be asking too much of its personnel.', '“F1 are doing more and more and they are going down the right path but 23 races is not a help toward that,” he said. “23 races is tough. The amount of racing is the only thing which can start to impact and take a toll on the team because they don’t get to see their families much especially with Covid and isolation. For me that is one of the biggest things.”', 'Race-hosting fees are one of the three biggest sources of income in F1 and after the season was curtailed last year with the consequent loss of revenue, the sport wanted to maximise the returns from this season. F1’s first triple-header took place in 2018 and was not received well by the teams, the consensus being that it would not be repeated. Last year triple headers were accepted as the only way to complete the 17-race season but the challenge of 2021 is far harder.', 'The teams are considering having to rotate personnel to ensure they have sufficient time off but that comes with an attendant increase in costs. Team bosses have expressed concern over the strain on their crews, as has Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.', '“In the end, the mechanics are the ones who are going to suffer a bit,” he said. “While the big bosses in Formula One arrive later and leave earlier, so of course there it doesn’t really change much.”', 'McLaren have a partnership with the mental health charity Mind and Norris believes they have made great strides in creating support structures. “As a team there is a lot in place now,” he said. “Not just for us as drivers but for the mechanics, the engineers because they are away from their families a lot. We do a lot with them in order for anyone in the team to come forward and speak to whoever they need to, not thinking they have to stay quiet.”', 'On the track in Baku, Mercedes struggled during practice. Verstappen, who leads Hamilton by four points in the world championship, headed the timesheets in first practice and his teammate Sergio Pérez was on top in the afternoon.', 'Hamilton however was left floundering off the pace.

  ["F1 to review rules after criticism of Belgian GP ‘race’ behind safety car","['McLaren’s Zak Brown: ‘We need a better solution as a sport’', 'F1 rejects Hamilton’s claim that decision was based on money']","['Formula One is to instigate urgent discussions to prevent a repeat of the scenario under which the Belgian Grand Prix was declared a race after only three laps behind the safety car in heavy rain.', 'There were scathing attacks after the events of Sunday, including from Lewis Hamilton, who described it as a farce, driven by financial considerations, and demanded that the fans should be refunded. ', 'F1 has since insisted financial expediency was not behind the decision. Nonetheless, other senior figures in the sport have declared Formula One must consider alternative options when races are threatened by bad weather.', 'The race at Spa-Francorchamps had initially been delayed by more than three hours as heavy rain made standing water and visibility too treacherous for racing. Then, despite the conditions having not improved, the governing body, the FIA, declared the race could begin. The cars duly emerged from the pit lane and completed three laps behind the safety car.', 'They completed the mandatory two laps for the event to be counted as a race and for half points to be awarded. The top finishing order remained exactly as it had been decided in qualifying. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was in first place, from George Russell for Williams, and the Mercedes of Hamilton in third.', 'The McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, was forthright in his opinion that F1 had to act to prevent a repeat of events that had tarnished the sport’s image. “The regulations state after you do a few laps it can be called a race and that needs to be reviewed,” he said. “I don’t think there is anyone that would argue the weather was safe to race in but we need a better solution as a sport. When that type of situation happens the outcome should not be a race after three laps behind a safety car.', '“That needs to be reviewed by all of us to learn from Sunday and realise if we are given this type of situation what we would do differently to make sure everyone gets their race in, whether that is the following day, or it comes back. It is complicated with the schedule but I don’t think anyone would say it felt right, calling that a race.”', 'The FIA race director, Michael Masi, said the governing body had followed its safety regulations and that the laps completed behind the safety car were to see what the conditions were like, with hope that there would be a window in the weather.', 'Masi believes F1, the FIA and the teams will meet shortly to address alternative options in future. “After this weekend and at our next meeting for next year we’ll look at a whole lot of things, to see what everyone wants,” he said. “We are at one of those points that the FIA works with all 10 teams and F1 to develop the regulations. So we will go through all of the various scenarios and see what everyone thinks.”', 'He also stated that despite other racing organisations such as IndyCar and Nascar having postponed and then held races on a Monday, F1 could not do so at Spa for a range of reasons. Rescheduling for the Monday would require agreement from F1, all the teams, the FIA and the race promoter. ', 'Logistically, it would have been extraordinarily complex; not least from a safety perspective in ensuring that all the marshals, who are volunteers, could return on what is a normal working day. There is also the issue of transport, flights and equipment and crew all booked into a tight schedule to get the teams to the next round, this weekend at Zandvoort in the Netherlands. It would also be expensive to rearrange.', 'F1’s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, meanwhile rejected Hamilton’s allegation that, despite only the minimum laps required to classify it as a race being completed, it was done to meet obligations to broadcasters, sponsors and ticket holders that would otherwise be entitled to financial recompense.', '“When I hear that there was some commercial discussion behind that, it’s totally not true,” he said. “When we’re talking about racing, there is responsibility, that is a clear process.”', 'He insisted that F1 would have received its race fee without the required laps happening and supported the decision made by the FIA in stopping and then restarting the race albeit briefly.', 'On Sunday the race promoters had no plan nor precedent for any scenario where a race had effectively not occurred.

  ["Dominic Thiem beats Zverev to set up Djokovic clash in Australian Open final","[' Austrian beats German 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4)']","['It is rare that a player wins a slam by beating both Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, in either order, in the same fortnight. Stan Wawrinka did it here in 2014 and Roger Federer came within two points of doing it at Wimbledon last year in a final against the Serbian that left him shattered.', 'So, Dominic Thiem, who defeated Nadal in the quarter-finals two days ago and reached the final with an intelligent dismantling of his dangerous but frenzied German friend, Alexander Zverev, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), in the second semi-final on Friday, will join an elite group if he can overcome Djokovic on Sunday. It is the tallest of orders.', 'As Thiem said courtside on Friday,: “I’m always facing the kings of the grand slams in finals. I lost to Rafa twice at Roland Garros. Now I’m facing Novak. He’s the king of Australia.”', 'He added: “It was an unreal match, two tie-breaks, so tough and so close. It is hard to break him [Zverev]. He had such a high percentage on his first serve [81%]. After playing four hours and 10 minutes against Rafa, I was in bed around 5am. It was not easy to recover, but the adrenaline came. Still, I had some troubles. We started with two breaks in our first semi-final here.', '“In the semi-finals of a slam, the level is so high and there are so many key moments, such as at the end of the second set. Then I was two set points down in the fourth, and saved [for the tie-break]. At the start of the fourth I was feeling nervous, putting so much effort, feeling my stomach, it was rebelling a little bit.', '“Sascha had a horrible ATP Cup and he worked so hard in preparation week for here. We’ve known he’s a great player for a very long time. Either of us could have won today. He’s still only 22. We won’t have to wait long until he’s in his first grand slam final.”', 'Thiem, at 26, is in his third against the defending champion reaching for his eighth Australian title and 17th major. History is weighing Thiem down elsewhere; he would be the first man born in the 1990s to win a major, and that would place him at the forefront of the new wave of challengers to the hegemony of the Big Three.', 'Both players were edgy in the early exchanges and it became obvious that, if neither could build an extended stretch of dominance, the match would go long. Zverev hit some huge winners to take the first set in 40 minutes, but Thiem, more defensive, recovered to level in exactly the same time.', 'The lights over one baseline failed briefly at the start of the third set – appropriate, perhaps, as both were playing lights-out tennis – and there was a seven-minute delay. The interruption seemed to disrupt Thiem, who missed a chance to go two games clear, more than it did Zverev who got back on serve and then pressured the Austrian for the rest of the frame.', 'Angered that a clean free-pointer was called out and not overruled – he had no challenges left – Zverev drilled a pair of statement aces and carried his rage into the next game, the longest to that point in the set. But Thiem stood firm, saving two break points, then forcing the tie-break after a love hold by Zverev.', 'While the German had outserved Thiem, the Austrian was playing the big moments more calmly, and went a set up with a superbly angled backhand.', 'Now small distractions invaded Zverev’s concentration. The match was heading for three hours, at 15-all in the second game of the fourth set, when, having already questioned the reliability of the let machine, he complained to the chair umpire about a screen high in the arena that clicked with fresh statistics after each point. In as much as it was in his line of vision, it had been like that throughout the tournament.', 'He held, but Thiem’s mood had switched from concerned to convinced he could win. It was the look he had when beating Nadal in the quarter-finals. But looks don’t win matches; points do.', 'Zverev was hitting with more venom, Thiem had relaxed certainty on his racket and, receiving in the ninth game, he worked his way to within two points of reaching the final. Zverev held for 5-5, and again, nervously, for the second tie-break.', 'There he double-faulted and made a mess of a routine smash at 2-4. He served at 4-6 but could do nothing about Thiem’s delicate volley at the end of three hours and 42 minutes of very good tennis.']","Australian Open 2020","Sport","2020-01-31",12.49,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5336ceb01111504fcce2c6ae35cc42641a9b26ed/144_343_3707_2224/master/3707.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=f28bfcb5ea65a60b6ae44e1db600a369","Dominic Thiem celebrates after winning against Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open.

He had that leg strapped for the semi-final and there were moments in some of the longer rallies in the two hours and 18 minutes in which he and Djokovic traded quality shots when his movement looked limited. Djokovic was pulling away at the end, to win 7-6 (1), 6-4, 6-3 and rarely has a scoreline been such an accurate barometer of the facts.', 'The first set was a microcosm of their rivalry. Federer blazed early – three aces in five minutes; after half an hour he held to love for 5-2 – before Djokovic worked his way into the story, and then they battled on level terms for a while before Federer’s resistance waned. Even on two good legs, he would have done well to break down Djokovic’s defence once the fire went out.', 'For nearly 40 minutes, Federer was in near-total control. He had struck 20 clean winners, eight of them aces. Then he briefly went missing and Djokovic, still fighting his own game, broke him to love. That was the turning point. He gave up only one point in the shootout and set about systematically hurting his stricken rival.', 'Federer had a medical timeout. He was not the same when he came back. As Mats Wilander observed on Eurosport: “It seemed like Novak could feel that Roger couldn’t move in to the corners, so he was trying to extend the rallies to get Federer wide on the backhand, or wide on the forehand and Roger was working against that.', '“Roger did not serve very well in the tie-breaker in the first set, that was the first time I realised something was slightly wrong. Clearly Roger was OK to put up a great fight. The first two sets were close. If I didn’t think he was injured before I would have never noticed.”', 'Djokovic explained how he fashioned his 27th win over Federer in their 50th match. “With Roger, you’re going to expect a high level of tennis,” he said. “He will always be aggressive, [apply] constant pressure, serve and volley. I’m not as natural as he is but I tried to stay with him in the rally, move him around, and not make too many unforced errors.”', 'In fact he kept them down to 18, about half Federer’s count. After the initial blitz, he soaked up 15 aces and fashioned 11 of his own. The second set was competitive but an air of inevitability entered the equation in the third. Djokovic put six aces past Federer and struck 12 of his 31 winners in the home stretch.', 'As for their mutual bond, Djokovic said: “I hope I made him a 20% better player than what he did to me. He’s one of my biggest two rivals in slams, Roger and Rafa. They made a considerable difference in my mind and how I play. It took a lot of thinking, belief and work to perfect the game and challenge those guys on the bigger stage.”', 'A more youthful challenge awaits him on Sunday – against Alexander Zverev or Dominic Thiem – and he said: “When you’re young you want everything right away. There’s no waiting. They are among the best young players, and have the potential to be there. One thing I lacked when I was younger was patience and trusting the process a little bit more. But that’s how you learn.”', 'These two fine champions have learned so much from each other, sharing the same tenacity and drive, but going about their business on court in such contrasting styles. Like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier were, they are almost a perfect fit.', 'But their statistics tell the story. Federer won seven of their first nine matches between 2006 and 2009. Things turned in Djokovic’s favour in 2011, when he burst into greatness, and after a prolonged spell of dominance from the Serb the pair continued to trade victories. However in their last 13 meetings, dating back to 2015, Djokovic has now won 10 of them. That is a trend that looks unlikely to change.']","Australian Open 2020","Sport","2020-01-30",12.48,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a529c54769e3ee8f8f1f78beb18f0cea9df9b2f/0_154_3402_2041/master/3402.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=42010085410f574c7e54ebe51d700f5e","Novak Djokovic celebrates success in the semi-final of the Australian Open.

  ["Thomas Tuchel says he is happier at Chelsea than he has been in years","['“I love it when other people are happy,” Thomas Tuchel said, imagining the after-party if Chelsea beat Manchester City in the Champions League final on Saturday night. “It means more to me around Christmas that I have good presents for others. It’s very hard to give me a gift. Maybe I’m not the guy to dance on the table, but I will be so super-happy if we win and I see my team, my staff, the families, and when I feel what it means to my family. This is huge for me.”']","['Five months after arriving in London, Tuchel sounds as if he is in a good place. The acrimonious manner of his split from Paris Saint-Germain, who sacked him on Christmas Eve, is in the past. Tuchel has barely put a foot wrong since joining Chelsea in January and, in contrast to the snappy persona he often presented at PSG and Borussia Dortmund, is in a compelling and playful mood as he prepares to face City in Porto.', 'Almost everything suggests that Chelsea picked well when they replaced Frank Lampard with Tuchel. Although they lost the FA Cup final to Leicester a fortnight ago, they qualified for the Champions League last weekend and stand 90 minutes from becoming European champions for the second time.', 'Their revival is down to Tuchel, who has united the dressing room and created a tactically cohesive unit. “I like a lot that the players here don’t go by instinct into the same groups,” Chelsea’s manager said. “They mix and I’m very happy that I don’t have to do it. I told them after two or three days here: ‘I like this a lot and don’t change it.’”', 'The concern when Tuchel joined was whether he would be able to handle the internal politics at Stamford Bridge. He admitted at the time that he was surprised when Chelsea, languishing in ninth place, offered only an 18-month deal. Yet Tuchel, who began his management career at Mainz in 2009, got on with it. The abrasiveness that overshadowed his spells at Dortmund and PSG has not been seen and Tuchel would be happy to discuss an extensionthis summer.', '“This is very easy,” he said. “I’m so happy to be here. I never felt so good since I was in Mainz [he left in 2014] and this feels like the perfect place and the perfect moment for the perfect place. Whatever will come will come. We cannot force things, but this is my point of view.”', 'Tuchel, who studied for a business administration degree and briefly worked as a barman in Stuttgart after injury forced him to retire aged 25, is a football obsessive. It can be amusing to watch him hopping up and down on the touchline when Chelsea’s moves break down but he does not mind if his players think he is off the wall.', '“It’s good if they laugh about me,” he said. “We should not take ourselves too seriously. I feel respect if they don’t laugh about me in a disrespectful way. We laugh about each other and I need to laugh about myself. There is no funnier place than a dressing room. There is no funnier place on earth. It’s impossible.', '“If they sometimes think the coach is crazy, good. If they sometimes are even a little bit in fear, good, even better. A little bit of fear is always good. And if we can laugh it out and if they are not scared to express their feelings, then it’s the way. We are all a little bit crazy.”', 'Tuchel’s tactical nous will be challenged by Pep Guardiola but he will not try to second-guess Manchester City’s manager. “It is always difficult to face Man City, Bayern or Barcelona when Pep is on the sideline,” he says. “Maybe they are the strongest team in Europe and maybe the world and they have built a huge gap between them and us in the league but we closed the gap for 90 minutes [in winning at City this month]. At Wembley [in the FA Cup], we closed the gap again for 90 minutes and that’s what we want to do again.”', 'Chelsea will have to be at their best. “Maybe we are slight underdogs but that changes nothing,” Tuchel says. “I want to encourage them to be brave, stay active, defend and attack with aggression.”', 'Tuchel lives a quiet life away from football. He meditates, reads, spends time with his family and thinks about his team. “Normally during the season, I drink no alcohol,” he said. “A glass of gin and tonic maybe but it’s almost zero.”', 'Yet Tuchel will let loose if Chelsea overcome City. He thinks about knocking back the gin and tonics. “We will have fun,” he promises.']","Chelsea","Sport","2021-05-28",17,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab2c9c743020c3175687170cf109d6661fc3c5e/0_159_5389_3235/master/5389.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=c24c18d72e22f5cab8d623384ee62b10","Thomas Tuchel says he was delighted to discover that Chelsea’s players avoid cliques.

  ["Manchester City and Chelsea continue to learn the lessons of Sacchi’s revolution","['The philosophies of Arrigo Sacchi, José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola will be evident in Saturday’s Champions League final']","['Like art, business or politics, football is shaped by personalities. The present one is influenced by three coaches from Italy, Portugal and Spain. This will also be evident at Saturday’s Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City, the highlight of the season.', 'The decisive innovation can be traced back to Arrigo Sacchi. He invented the operating system that is still valid, the Microsoft of football, without which nothing works: ball-oriented spatial coverage. With this kind of choreographed play, he shaped Milan around the outstanding individualists Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Ruud Gullit and Roberto Donadoni into the strongest team in the world. They reached their zenith in 1989, beating Real Madrid 5-0 in the semi-finals of the European Cup and Steaua Bucharest, winners in 1986 and with the future world star Gheorghe Hagi in their team, 4-0 in the final.', 'Their moves were of a higher quality and the brilliantly organised Milan kept involving the opponent in duels that led to ball losses. Steaua hardly crossed the halfway line, goals inevitably fell and the winner was clear after 30 minutes. Any self-respecting coach must have seen these 90 minutes of unequal competition.', 'Sacchi drove progress, first in Italy. Other Misters, as Italy’s coaches are known for their appearance and wardrobe, adopted his style. Most notably Fabio Capello, who dominated Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona with Milan in a 4-0 victory in the 1994 final. Or Marcello Lippi, who reached three finals in a row with Juventus from 1996 to 1998, and one player under Sacchi, Carlo Ancelotti, has won the trophy three times as a coach.', 'At that time, Italy’s football was the ultimate because patrons such as Silvio Berlusconi and Angelo Moratti financed the clubs. With their millions, they attracted the best players. As a result, Serie A won the European Cup/Champions League five times between 1989 and 2003, and the Uefa Cup and the Cup Winners’ Cup a combined 11 out of 26 times. During that time, seven clubs from Italy won a European trophy, including Parma, Sampdoria, Napoli and Lazio. No league could match that.', 'Germany also benefited from Italy’s high standard. In 1990, West Germany became world champions, partly because almost half the team around Lothar Matthäus played in Serie A. From 1995, the modern operating system was installed in Bayern Munich’s junior team; the ball-oriented spatial coverage and the four-man back line were revolutionary in Germany. I became German champion with the under-19s in 2001 and 2002 – a first for Bayern.', 'You always need someone who takes on the ideas of others and enriches them with his own. Our Sacchi was Björn Andersson, who won the European Cup with Bayern in the 1970s. He didn’t treat us young players authoritatively, but at eye level. With this Scandinavian pedagogy, the Swede gave my generation a new style of leadership – flat hierarchies, discussion, participation.', 'Innovation never goes undetected. In different locations, other coaches adapted Sacchi, developed their own programmes, added their interpretation, formed great teams with continuity, dissolved Italy’s domination. For more than a quarter of a century, Alex Ferguson gave Manchester United stability, his side resembled an attacking machine. With his flair for character, he led them to the Champions League final four times, winning in 1999 and 2008.', 'Louis van Gaal captured the title in 1995 with Ajax, a club from a minor league with a history of attacking football. Ottmar Hitzfeld, a master of words and people management, won titles with Dortmund (1997) and Bayern (2001). Jupp Heynckes won with Real Madrid in 1998 and Bayern in 2013, Vicente del Bosque with Real in 2000 and 2002. Frank Rijkaard, title winner with Barcelona in 2006, was also a Sacchi player.', 'Then José Mourinho came along. His doctrine of modern catenaccio took the offensive spirit out of football. With underdogs Porto, he triumphed in the Uefa Cup in 2003 and the Champions League the following year. In the semi-final and final in 2004, the opponent failed to score. During this period, everyone was talking about playing against the ball.', 'Mourinho minimises the risk of conceding a goal. Thanks to a high level of organisation and physical strength, his teams achieve curious defensive feats. For example, he built a human barricade around the penalty area with Internazionale in the 2010 semi-final at Barcelona. His teams lie in wait for the ball to be lostand they use this moment of vulnerability to raid the goal with just a few moves. In 2010, in the final against Inter, our Bayern team was outplayed.', 'One of Mourinho’s champions is Diego Simeone. He has been directing Atlético Madrid to a finely tuned 11-man defence for 10 years. He has won the Europa League twice and recently secured the Spanish championship for the second time. Twice he has been in the final of the Champions League, when he lost narrowly. In 2014 and 2016 – that is, at a time when another era had long since dawned.', 'It was the heyday of possession. It went back to Pep Guardiola, who responded to Mourinho and rolled out Sacchi offensively. Guardiola attacked. He allowed the romantic ideology of total football, with which Cruyff had reached limits in the 90s, to grow into a new flower in Barcelona. He wanted complete control of the game, tying up the opponent in the attacking half and if the ball was ever lost, they were supposed to win it back in front.', 'That’s how you stifle the buildup of the others, a permanent offence is created. In the first leg of our 2009 quarter-final, Barcelona beat Bayern 4-0. In the 2009 and 2011 finals, Manchester United almost didn’t get the ball. Barça were overpowering.', 'It was epochal, born in Spain and therefore had an enormous impact on the national team, which was almost unbeatable at the time. Guardiola’s play with the ball then permeated international football.', 'Transitions are always fluid and great coaches find intermediate solutions. In the mid-2010s, Real Madrid dominated the Champions League, winning in 2014, 2016 and 2018. The biggest club in the world always attracts the best footballers. It would have taken a long search to strengthen the XI around Luka Modric, Ronaldo, Sergio Ramos, Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos.', 'But football is not just strategy, which brings us to another recent example: Jürgen Klopp. He answers Guardiola with passion, physicality, belief, anarchy and dynamic counterattacking. Klopp always finds an emotional connection with his players. His final appearance with Dortmund in 2013 was a strong performance. He advanced to the final twice with Liverpool, a citythat fits his mentality perfectly. In 2019, he won.', 'Sacchi, Mourinho and Guardiola – the ball-oriented operating system, playing with the ball and against it, total offence, lurking on the counterattack – all this will also be on display in Porto. Because no team currently has the dominance Milan had or that the Spaniards later had, all the top teams contain this three-part mixture, including the two finalists. Manchester City and Chelsea want to lay siege to their opponents in the penalty area and put them under pressure there with gegenpressing, but they also retreat again and again and leave the ball and initiative to them.', 'Both clubs have charismatic coaches. Guardiola’s style remains recognisable, but he borrows defensively from Mourinho because his team is not as regally put together as Real’s or Barça’s. Thomas Tuchel is the first coach to reach two finals in a row with two different clubs. He has found recognition among the 10 or so clubs that turnover between about €500m and €1bn a year and can compete internationally. This results in an approximate equality of forces. It will probably be an exciting final.', 'Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian.

It follows aborted discussions with the UK government over bringing the match to Wembley.', 'Both Chelsea and City are now immersing themselves in the necessary logistical planning that will make a short-notice overseas trip possible in the time of Covid. City have informed fans that packages of tickets and flights will be available to “qualified supporters”, though details are yet to be confirmed. But Portugal’s cabinet affairs minister, Mariana Vieira da Silva, said those attending would “come and return on the same day, with a test done, in a bubble situation, on charter flights”.', 'She added: “There will be two fan zones and from there they will be moved to the stadium and from the stadium to the airport, being in Portugal less than 24 hours. Obviously those coming by plane [to be in Porto while the match is on but do not actually go the stadium] will comply with the established rules and security measures will be put in place as happened in Lisbon last year.”', 'While the ultimate capacity of the final crowd is also still to be announced, further tickets will go on sale to the general public from 24 May. The question for fans hoping to travel, however, will be whether they can afford to buy a flight. On Thursday afternoon Easyjet’s lowest fare from London or Manchester to Porto on 28 May was £299. To return to Manchester on the day after the match would be another £419.', 'Hotel accommodation for two nights remains available starting from £250. Supporters who plan on travelling to Portugal will also be expected to record a negative PCR test result before leaving the UK.', 'Istanbul was originally due to host the final until the UK government placed Turkey on its travel red list last Friday. That would in effect have meant the match would have been played without supporters, forcing Uefa into having to contemplate a new venue. Wembley quickly became an alternative option after Boris Johnson said “it would be brilliant to host the game here if we can”. Ultimately several days of talks came to nothing as the UK failed to offer quarantine exemptions Uefa requested for the game.', 'In his remarks on announcing Porto as the new host, the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, made specific reference to those discussions. “We accept that the decision of the British government to place Turkey on the red list for travel was taken in good faith and in the best interests of protecting its citizens from the spread of the virus but it also presented us with a major challenge in staging a final featuring two English teams,” he said.', '“The difficulties of moving the final are great and the FA and the authorities made every effort to try to stage the match in England and I would like to thank them for their work in trying to make it happen.”', 'Ceferin added that he hoped the final would represent a positive moment in the passing of the Covid-19 pandemic. “I hope the final will be a symbol of hope at the re-emergence of Europe from a difficult period and that the fans who travel to the game will once again be able to lend their voices to showcase this final as the best in club football,” he said.']","Champions League","Sport","2021-05-13",11.32,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0dc3073174e205bc9b1f3a8bdd49e08b3c266d6/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=73b09f0f3847626b73d0dc4f3db9db3b","Porto’s Estádio do Dragão, where the Champions League final is due to be played.

Currently visitors from France and the Netherlands, among other countries, have to undergo a 14-day quarantine upon entering Portugal.', 'The UK government claimed that requests over quarantine waivers led to stalemate in discussions this week over moving the match to Wembley, after English fans had been banned from travelling to the original location of Istanbul.

  ["Manchester City v Chelsea: bravura final battle is held up by healthy bottom line","['These furiously evolving teams deserve their place in the final, but wealth of their owners and Premier League certainly helps']","['Les Anglais sont arrivés. Yes, it’s that time of the year again. The darling buds of May are, with all due sense of caution, beginning to bloom. And the Premier League is all set for its annual European away day.', 'First things first: the presence of two English clubs in the Champions League final is a source of huge pride and excitement for supporters of both teams. For Chelsea this is another high-water mark in the boom years, a season that has turned completely on its head after the rancour and impotence of midwinter. For longtime fans of Manchester City this represents a scarcely credible, beautifully executed journey’s end, more than a decade on from the complete making-over of the club.', 'There will be internal triumphalism for the Premier League and high fives in the committee rooms of the major UK rights holders. West London meets east Manchester in Istanbul – this is a bravura occasion for English sport, and reward for two genuinely captivating groups of players, brilliantly coached, and speckled with high-class homegrown product. Chelsea versus Manchester City, summer 2021, is all of these things. But it isn’t, in any sense, a surprise.', 'There are always phases in sport. The thing that is happening now is not the thing that will always happen. But the fact remains, right now, Premier League domination is the baseline. Five of the past eight Champions League finalists have been Premier League clubs.', 'And this is how it should be given the increasingly linear relationship between money and success. Five of the nine wealthiest clubs in the world operate in the Premier League. Two of those – Chelsea and City as it happens – are owned by sponsors with bottomless pockets, entities who aren’t in this business to make a profit, but for other, rather opaque and unexpressed reasons.', 'In a time of collapsing finances, City can comfortably maintain a £220m wage bill and pay Pep Guardiola £18m a year to apply his brilliance at the Eastlands campus. Where others feared financial collapse, Chelsea saw a sensible investment opportunity and gambled £200m on attacking talent, albeit much of it raked back in sales related to previous excess spending. lls sont les meilleurs! Sie sind die Besten! Yeah, well, all of that probably. But we’re back either way. And yet, this being football, the most gloriously resilient sporting substance, even this deeply familiar fixture looks fresh and moreish.', 'Istanbul will be the fourth time these teams have played each other in five months this calendar year. Both have evolved furiously in that time. City’s 3-1 win in January at Stamford Bridge was the launchpad for a shift towards the current pared-back winning machine, and a headline success for the false-nine system. Chelsea were in the process of ceasing to be Frank Lampard’s team. By the time these two met again in April for an FA Cup semi-final early Tuchel-ism had taken hold, that girdle of defensive strength strapped into place.', 'Victory on Saturday for City against Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium will seal the League title. But there are of course major subplots here now, a game of bluff and mental edge before that final in three weeks’ time. It is a good match-up, too. Both managers are drawn, as a first principle, towards keeping the ball. Both have experimented this season with deep, resilient defence. There is a narrative around both teams that their attacking patterns – intricate and technical versus high-speed transition – are let down by the lack of a classic rapier finisher.', '1972 Uefa Cup: Tottenham 3-2 Wolves', \"The first all-English final was almost 50 years ago. Spurs won 2-1 at Molineux in the first leg, Martin Chivers scoring both goals. Alan Mullery put Tottenham further ahead in the second leg, and they held on despite Dave Wagstaffe's equaliser at White Hart Lane.\", '2008 Champions League: Man Utd 1-1 Chelsea (6-5 pens)', \"The slip seen around the world, as John Terry missed the chance to seal Chelsea's first Champions League title in the penalty shootout. Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka's penalty to seal United's third European Cup. The game finished 1-1 after 120 minutes in Moscow, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard scoring the goals.\\xa0\", '2019 Europa League: Chelsea 4-1 Arsenal', \"This London derby in Azerbaijan was won decisively by Chelsea, who took the lead through former Gunner Olivier Giroud. Eden Hazard scored twice and set up Pedro for Chelsea's fourth, with Alex Iwobi grabbing a consolation goal as Arsenal missed out on a Champions League place.\", '2019 Champions League: Liverpool 2-0 Tottenham', \"Another all-Premier League affair in 2019, as Liverpool won their sixth European Cup in Madrid, a year on from losing the final to Real Madrid. Mo Salah put Liverpool ahead from the penalty spot after two minutes, but it wasn't until Divock Origi (pictured) got a late second goal that Jürgen Klopp's side could celebrate. PA\", 'This is a little old school in itself. Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel don’t set up without an orthodox centre‑forward because of some kind of oversight or failure of recruitment. They want to play this way, to score in this way, to prioritise other patterns. And for all the reservations (where is their Niall Quinn, their Kerry Dixon?) City are top scorers in the Premier League, while Chelsea have 14 in six Champions League away games. They missed a lot of chances against Paris Saint‑Germain and Real Madrid. But this also involved making a lot of chances.', 'The final will be fascinating for other reasons. Both managers are interventionists and details merchants. There will be a game of tactical feint and counter-feint. The assumption might be that this will suit Tuchel, who after all reached the Champions League final last year and who has a reputation for succeeding in these managerial two-handers.', 'But there is also a misconception about Guardiola, overthinking and the “bottling” of one-off games. It seems fair to suggest the reason Guardiola has been vulnerable on these occasions is systemic rather than a failing of personality. His style is a league style, not a knockout style. His methods are not geared towards one-off collisions, where intuitive moves, emotion, or being able to snatch the day can decide the contest.', 'Guardiola creates a system, a machine for winning, something that will over a season operate at a pitch that is impossible to match. This will occasionally be derailed by opponents who are equally able and who have a gameplan that can pick away at a Guardiola team’s strengths. Perhaps Tuchel will look to exploit João Cancelo’s tendency to roam inside, as he did in the FA Cup game. Perhaps Guardiola will counter, as he did against PSG, by rejigging his full-backs. It may or may not work. But this is not some fatal flaw, or evidence of bald fraudulism. Every way of winning has its weak point.', 'The base position remains the same, though. The Premier League is dominant because it is the richest football environment in the world. City are the best team in that league by some distance, an amalgam of squad depth, supreme organisation and the resources to make that vision work. They should be comfortable favourites to win this game.', 'After which, well, what exactly? Both of these teams occupy a strange space in the operatic wranglings of Big Football. Here we have two founder members of the Super League, a failed assassination of Uefa’s grand old show, now queuing up to waggle that cup around on top of a podium in era-defining glory.', 'Both were quick to backtrack when the whole thing fell apart – shocked to find this was, in fact, a terrible PR move. But then, joining it was always a weird personal choice given reputation, fame, soft blurry feelings of love – whatever – is the reason these owners are in the game in the first place, as opposed to making a few quid.', 'This is the broader, noisier subtext to an all-English final. The Super League was, above all, an attack on the Premier League’s primacy. It was an attack by billionaires on other, more powerful billionaires. This match-up, Istanbul 2021, England versus England, is another pointer to why it happened; and why it is almost certainly coming back.']","Champions League","Sport","2021-05-06",20.45,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/580a42694e82363ce762e5441b2f53e0e17316d0/0_65_3841_2304/master/3841.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d6caeeea727dfa5bf9b1fd417755a6d9","Ben Chilwell tackles João Cancelo in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.

Questions such as: just how good are Bayern Munich? How bad, exactly, is almost everyone else? And can we just fast forward to the bit where Bayern and Liverpool finally get to pile into one another like a pair of peak-career Mexican middleweights?', 'Bayern erected another milestone on Tuesday at the Red Bull Arena, extending their record Champions League winning run to 14 games with a startlingly open 6-2 shellacking of RB Salzburg.', 'Steamrollering runs of form have become a feature of European club football as talent and wealth is hoarded ever more closely. This, though, is something distinct. Bayern will head into Der Klassiker on Saturday on the back of nine straight wins, plus five trophies won in the past five months. Two things stand out about this supremacy. First, it has come from something close to a standing start. Bayern sacked the gloom-ridden Niko Kovac last November. Since then the same group of players has won 11 games straight in the Champions League, including an entire shortened knockout stage, by an aggregate score of 42-7.', 'Second, and more striking, is the style of their dominance, just how beautifully well-suited that merciless front-foot game of sprints is to the current seasick state of European football.

Teams have not been built, plans have not been laid. Some of these alleged champion teams resemble a collapsed souffle, oozing at the edges, soft in the middle, basic shape just about recognisable.', 'There is a paradox here. The football may be fan-free and played to order, an uncomfortably synthetic spectacle. But it is also entertaining as a TV product, and perversely authentic in some ways. Here, finally, we get a rare glimpse at times of heavily conditioned elite players performing off the cuff.', 'It is a kind of looseness that suits Bayern’s strengths and it was there very clearly on Tuesday in a Group B fixture that resembled something from a more carefree era, a galloping, cavalry officer kind of sport.', 'Bayern and Salzburg took 39 shots at goal. There were overturned penalties, shots against the post, a thrilling goal from Serge Gnabry ruled out by offside. Bayern scored four times in 11 minutes at the end as Leroy Sané and Douglas Costa entered a pitch drowning in lactic acid. Before then, though, Salzburg passed the ball with fizz and zip, Dominik Szoboszlai a constant menace, and often found space behind the Bayern defence.', 'This is the paradox of Bayern and the allure of their style. The advantages of blitzing midfield and relentlessly crowding opponents are deemed greater than the risks of pushing high in defence and relying on the odd burst of recovery speed.', 'It is a robust, concussive style and one that seems ideally suited to lockdown football. Bayern want to tear you apart in the opening 10 minutes, then tear you apart all over again for the remaining 80. But their methods are quite linear, based on rapid movement, clear passing lines and by a team without technical or physical weak links.', 'Bayern don’t just pass the ball, they spank it about at fearsome speed, shaving off touches taken and time in static possession. If the Spanish passing style feels like watching something being mercilessly unpicked, this is a constant battering at the hinges, a sustained blowing off of the doors.', 'It has been suggested the more careful, high-maintenance passing rhythms of a classic Pep Guardiola team will be hard to drill in the current schedule. Whereas Bayern, like Liverpool, have a less complex, more obviously repeatable set of movements, concerned as much with speed of execution as the carefully wrought manipulation of space.', 'It is an Anglo-German (or rather German-German) comparison worth making. If only because this is the match-up European football seems to be leaning towards. Liverpool and Bayern cannot meet until March. Plenty can change before then. But on the evidence of the last year these are not just the two leading teams, but a fascinating prospect in opposition.', 'Liverpool were wonderfully surgical in attack in the 5-0 defeat of Atlanta on Tuesday, albeit against brutally outclassed opponents. Goals three and five basically involved Liverpool players running unhindered from halfway to score.', 'More striking was the way Diogo Jota’s diagonal runs found pockets of space behind a high defensive line, a reminder that Liverpool’s most convincing attacking rhythms are geared towards exploiting this kind of defensive shape. Bayern have played like this, and won like this, for the past 12 months, taking a risk to feed a strength. In a time of confusion the two most coherent teams in Europe look an excellent world title match-up.', 'The football may feel unplanned, off the cuff and even oddly liberated.

I don’t understand the criticism.”', 'Liverpool face what Klopp described as “the biggest challenge in the Champions League” so far on Tuesday when they visit last season’s quarter-finalists Atalanta in Bergamo. Gian Piero Gasperini’s team scored 98 goals in Serie A last season, the highest total in Italy’s top flight for more than 60 years, and Klopp believes there are comparisons between their style and Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds.', 'Klopp, who has Joël Matip, Naby Keïta and Kostas Tsimikas back in training after injury, said: “Atalanta are very special in their approach, slightly similar to Leeds. Top players, top recruitment, very well organised, play their system with 100% conviction; they know exactly what everyone has to do and use the skills of individuals in incredibly smart ways.', '“You can see [Alejandro] Gómez in midfield, a completely free, floating genius and they make it very difficult to catch him. There has been some impressive developments of players. They have a lot of these kind of stories and in the team there is a really good atmosphere and a good mood.', '“Their last season was a good one and we know how difficult the season was for everyone in Bergamo [because of the coronavirus pandemic]. They dealt with the situation and I respect that. I know how good they are. I enjoyed analysing them because it is really interesting and if you see something interesting you should try to learn a little bit from it. It will be a tough one.”', 'Liverpool are top of their Champions League group with a 100% record and have also risen to the Premier League summit since the setbacks of losing 7-2 at Aston Villa and Virgil van Dijk’s injury. Trent Alexander-Arnold admits the champions were “humbled” by that emphatic defeat at Villa Park but have rediscovered their focus as a result.', '“It was about self-reflection in that period [after Villa] and knowing that can’t happen,” the defender said. “It was kind of a one-off. To concede seven goals is unacceptable but it is about learning from these things. It kind of humbled us as a team and it let us know we can’t just win games because we are Liverpool with the history of the club and the players we’ve got. It is about mentality and the work we put in. If we are not at 100% these things can happen.', '“It wasn’t an outrageously bad performance but our mentality wasn’t there on the day and we got punished. Since then we have been really able to focus on that and looking back on the last two years especially, it is our mentality that has got us to where we are now. ', '“It has enabled us to come back from any position, to break through walls and kick down doors in that respect. Since that game we have been able to get back into that stride.”']","Mohamed Salah","Sport","2020-11-02",15.28,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f55cccd18f36730fc23f670c6bee95749b32a14/0_148_1530_918/master/1530.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d7cb25c247b4aef6e662002d67d2a025","Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah had three marks on his foot from the West Ham game and ‘one of them is from the penalty situation’.

Rashford may have been making most of his headlines off the pitch in recent weeks and Fernandes finding himself a member of a rather crowded selection panel for midfield, but the pair are United’s leading goal scorers this season.', 'Resting Rashford left United with only Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood up front, almost a return to a 4-4-2 formation, except that neither of the forward attacking options operated as a central sharp edge in front of goal.', 'Resting Fernandes allowed Solskjær to give Donny van de Beek some time on the pitch, the former Ajax player’s virtual invisibility in Premier League games having attracted comment and criticism after a £35m transfer, but without the Portugal international’s energy and invention behind the front two, United began looking conservative and oddly unthreatening.', 'Paul Scholes, working as a pundit and putting his finger on the point as usual, said it looked as though they were playing away from home. True enough, but without the usual 75,000 crowd offering encouragement and partisan fervour, is home advantage even relevant any longer?', 'Leipzig, by the same token, were supposed to be playing away, yet an empty Old Trafford is hardly the full European experience. Not so much Theatre of Dreams as undercooked cauldron of caution. The snazziest thing by far about the German side was the excessively loud jacket worn by their manager Julian Nagelsmann, a stripy acid-blue number that was practically alone among the visitors in sparkling under the lights.', 'It might be remembered that José Mourinho first made a name for himself by attracting attention when celebrating a Porto win at this stadium, though even the soon-to-be special one was dressed more demurely in a dark blue coat.', 'On the pitch, Van de Beek was tidy and efficient without suggesting he deserves a regular slot ahead of Paul Pogba or Nemanja Matic. At least he was kept on when the latter was withdrawn after an hour, but only to appreciate he also faces competition from Fred and Scott McTominay. As Solskjær keeps emphasising, he is not short of options in midfield, and the questions about where Van de Beek would fit in surfaced when he signed, not simply after a few weeks of bench warming.', 'The consensus in summer was that Van de Beek was a signing for the future, possibly an insurance against Pogba departing at some point, though until Fernandes came on with 20 minutes to go there was no doubt Pogba was the most influential of the home midfield pack.', 'Greenwood’s finish for the opening goal was characteristically crisp and accurate, but the ball to his feet from Pogba was what cut the visitors’ defence apart. Pogba almost did it again in the second half with an imaginative pass that invited Martial to break his goal drought, only to find his fellow French international could not quite summon a finish to match Greenwood’s.', 'In all probability one goal would have been enough for United, Leipzig never really looked like getting back on terms even after bringing on a couple of attacking substitutes, but in further bad news for Van de Beek his manager sent on first Fernandes then Rashford for the later stages.', 'He had only been on the pitch for a few minutes when Fernandes found him with an instinctive pass into space, one that Rashford not only collected but wisely went on to put away, important when VAR overruled the referee’s assistant who failed to spot he was still in his own half when the ball was played.', 'Within minutes Rashford would again finish impeccably when Fred won the ball just outside the Leipzig area, then magnanimously eschew the chance of a hat-trick by allowing Martial to claim a goal from the penalty spot. No problem – the striker was able to pounce again in stoppage time – proving that not only is he a hero for our times with confidence levels verging on the stratospheric, he can do a decent impersonation of what his manager used to get up to back in the day.', 'Rashford’s emphatic contribution after entering the fray on 62 minutes suggested Solskjær knew exactly what he was keeping in reserve, and though the United manager has not had everything his own way in the Premier League thus far, in Europe it is impossible to argue with another win in Paris followed by a 5-0 leathering of the form side in the Bundesliga.', 'Solskjær’s stock is on the rise again, whereas long before the end, Nagelsmann could be seen trying to hide his beacon of a blazer behind the brickwork of the visitors’ dugout.']","Manchester United","Sport","2020-10-29",8.23,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98978b3fb4d3a1415ba4fea561cab358ef73d8f6/0_77_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ab5c711e734eb8236c8498c906b914f2","Marcus Rashford gets a pat on the back from his Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, after his three goals against RB Leipzig.

Leon Goretzka doubled Bayern’s lead five minutes before half-time as Hansi Flick’s side defied predictions of a close battle between the two Group A heavyweights.', 'Corentin Tolisso made sure of victory in spectacular fashion midway through the second half. After a free-kick was cleared, the midfielder struck an unstoppable effort into Jan Oblak’s top corner from 30 yards out. Coman added his second of the night, finishing off a sweeping counter attack by sliding the ball inside the far post.', '“Our game was just good tonight,” Flick said after the game. “It was a tough task but we mastered it. Our efficiency was good today and I am very satisfied. It is very important to win that first game. We had a match plan and we applied it, playing out four beautiful goals.”', 'In Group A’s early game, Red Bull Salzburg and Lokomotiv Moscow drew 2-2 in Austria. Eder put the visitors ahead early on, before Dominik Szoboszlai equalised on the stroke of half-time with a ferocious long-range strike. Salzburg took a second-half lead through Zlatko Junuzovic, but Vitali Lisakovich’s far-post header meant the spoils were shared.', 'Romelu Lukaku rescued Internazionale with a late equaliser at home against Borussia Mönchengladbach, who thought they had caused a second Group B shock of the night after Shakhtar Donetsk’s 3-2 win at Real Madrid.', 'Lukaku fired Inter ahead just after half-time, but the visitors levelled when Arturo Vidal was penalised for fouling Marcus Thuram in the area. Ramy Bensebaini converted the penalty, before Jonas Hofmann finished a clinical counter attack in the 84th minute. With time running out, Lukaku bundled home from a corner to earn Antonio Conte’s side a valuable point before their trip to Ukraine next Tuesday.', 'Atalanta showed Liverpool they will offer competition for top spot in Group D by beating Midtjylland 4-0.

Yet at the Gewiss Stadium Varane was forced off in the first half and Solskjær said: “It’s a hamstring and I didn’t want to take a risk. On the first assessment it doesn’t look good but we will assess him again tomorrow.”', 'As United’s defence was again a problem against Gian Piero Gasperini’s side the loss of Varane, for what might be a number of weeks, would be a setback.', 'Solskjær, though, praised the “incredible” Cristiano Ronaldo after he was again United’s saviour when equalising twice – in added time of the first and second half – to earn what might prove an invaluable draw.', 'It means United head Group F with seven points on goal difference from Villarreal with the Spanish club and Young Boys left to play. Ronaldo’s fourth and fifth strikes of the phase cancelled out Josip Illicic’s opener and Duván Zapata’s second, which had each given Atalanta the lead.', 'Solskjær brushed off any concern that United are too reliant on the 36-year-old forward. “We all have our roles and responsibilities,” the Norwegian said. “Cristiano is a leader in the group, he scores goals. I’m sure Chicago Bulls didn’t mind having Michael Jordan, either – sometimes the teams have the players they have and that’s why they are Manchester United, Chicago Bulls, you come up with those moments.', '“Cristiano is getting better and better for us, he’s feeling better and up to speed now – he didn’t have a full pre-season.

  ["'It's lovely to be here': county cricket fans return to the Oval","['First trial of fans returning to live sport since Covid-19 shutdown']","['It was only 10.30 on a quiet Sunday morning in Kennington, south London, but the beers were already flowing. And for good reason.', 'After four months of cardboard cutouts warming the seats of silent stadiums across the UK, spectators finally returned in the flesh to sport for a friendly county cricket fixture between Surrey and Middlesex at the Oval.“It has been the highlight of the lockdown, as it were,” said Neil Fraser, who attended alongside his partner, Jenny. “This has been something that I’ve missed – we’ve been waiting for cricket to come back and this is the first time we have been out in the whole time.”They were two among an exclusive and fortunate group. Surrey county cricket club boasts 13,500 members and the Oval, its home ground, has a capacity of 25,500, yet just 1,000 seats were available. Surrey Cricket had been uncertain about the number of fans who would even be interested, but on Wednesday morning the dozen staff members manning the phones were overwhelmed by 10,000 calls placed in the first hour alone.“I rang quite a few times, got horrible lift music for half an hour,” said John, a 15-year-long club member from Chelmsford, Essex. “I complained a bit, and that worked. At 3 o’clock I got through. Ten thousand calls in the first hour! I don’t know how I got a ticket in the end.”', 'By midday, most fans had arrived and they were sequestered in the cosy 1845 stand, separated two seats apart in each row and with every other row of seats left vacant. After months of artificial background noise at sporting events, even the smallest facets of a real, live crowd were to be cherished: the spontaneous oohs after a peachy cover drive, the volume of applause rising and falling according to the crowd’s enthusiasm in the moment. Even the ambient chatter felt like a positive feature rather than an annoyance in these strange times. Another sign of life.', 'Those who made the trip left their fears behind, but the walkways of the Oval were still a microcosm of a society that does not agree. As fans trickled in, some marked their arrival by tearing their masks from their faces and they insisted on speaking with voices unmuffled. Others rushed to ensure that their masks were tightly fastened as soon as they noticed this journalist approaching.Sue, a member since her retirement four years ago, aligned firmly into the former camp. Asked if she was at all wary of being among people again, she immediately shook her head.“Not in the slightest,” she said. “I couldn’t wait to get here. I’ve been out and about as and when I’ve been allowed to. Throughout the whole process, I made a point of going out every day, walking a lot.', '“[Lockdown] started frightening, then I got very angry. Just the whole frustration of it all. We’re not used to it, are we? Not used to being told what to do.”', 'Throughout the day, fans acted sensibly, keeping their distance in the crowd and beyond. Richard Gould, Surrey’s chief executive, suggested that club members were even more incentivised to be reasonable in order to ensure that they could return once more. As they told stories of their affinity to the Oval, many seemed to agree. One fan, who did not wish to be named, likened his return to “coming home”.', 'Another, Natalia, explained that she moved to Britain a decade ago. When she recently reapplied for her work visa, her host family provided a testimony in her application.“One of the reasons we put for why she should have her work visa renewed is because she has become assimilated to British culture and has a membership at Surrey. I think that went a long way into renewing her permit,” said Christine, her host mother, laughing.Still, this spectacle was not simply to please fans. As the government sets into motion its optimistic plans to bring audiences back to stadiums in October, this marked the first test. Members of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport were on hand to watch as the day unfolded. Further tests follow next week at the world snooker championship and the Goodwood horse racing festival.Gould asserted that with 100 staff on hand to just 1,000 spectators, not even a 30% capacity of the entire stadium would be financially viable. Attendance accounts for 90% of Surrey Cricket’s annual £3m matchday revenue and it is currently also missing out on the £6m usually generated from conferences and events at the facilities. His view of a sporting world without sufficient crowds for too long is bleak.“We need to be back to normal next summer,” Gould said. “If we’re not back to normal next summer, the structure, not just of our sport but all sports, will need to change.”As they returned to watch the sport they love in person, such concerns were far from the minds of the fans. They were too busy soaking in the view once more.', '“On a hot summer’s day, there is nothing nicer than sitting and watching cricket,” said John of Chelmsford. “Even if it’s boring as hell, it’s still lovely to be here.”']","Cricket","Sport","2020-07-26",18.49,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3220dc6146d27db43e6c5cf9807707f9091f13/0_218_5030_3020/master/5030.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=07cf7ad013c2e0e49dc0ad8e3fa7af4d","Just 1000 spectator seats were available for the Surrey v Middlesex friendly match at the Oval.

But according to reports Surrey, MCC (Lord’s), Lancashire and Warwickshire are proposing to host a crunched-down finish to the IPL in the UK during the second half of September. It is an ambitious idea given the sheer volume of cricketers and support staff required to travel and quarantine, even factoring in that India’s Test players would already be in the country.', 'An ECB spokesperson said: “We speak to the BCCI regularly about tours and other matters and we’ll continue doing so, but we have received no indication that they are looking for alternative hosts for the IPL at the moment.”', 'Meanwhile New Zealand have confirmed Trent Boult will miss the first Test against England at Lord’s next month and possibly the second at Edgbaston following a request to fly home and see his family after the IPL’s collapse.

  ["IPL plays on as BCCI’s cash cow while India’s Covid-19 crisis worsens","['With players withdrawing and the death toll spiralling, the financial justification is all that is keeping the show going']","['At what point during a global pandemic do you ask yourself: must the show go on? The Indian Premier League is now near that point as the action moves to Delhi, the nation’s capital, and Ahmedabad, the new cricket capital. Both are locations that continue to be severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.', 'England’s Liam Livingstone, the Australians Andrew Tye, Adam Zampa and Kane Richardson, and, perhaps most significant, India’s Ravichandran Ashwin have all left the 2021 IPL for Covid-related reasons. While some of those players withdrew citing the difficulty of the biosecure-bubble life, and others because they did not want to be stuck in a foreign country as their homelands began to shut down borders, Ashwin’s departure is particularly relevant.', 'On Sunday I asked Ashwin, on Twitter, if he had considered staying at home, given this was the advice he was dispensing to his 10.3 million followers, and was met with a barrage of abuse from the cricketer’s followers and fans.', 'Not long afterwards, Ashwin announced, via the same medium: “I would be taking a break from this year’s IPL from tomorrow. My family and extended family are putting up a fight against #COVID19 and I want to support them during these tough times. I expect to return to play if things go in the right direction.”', 'Ashwin has always been a cricketer who sees the bigger picture and, though the details behind his decision have not been disclosed, it is unlikely to have been made independently from the startling numbers in the public domain. Since this edition of the IPL began on 9 April nearly 30,000 people have lost their lives in India to Covid-19, according to official figures. If anecdotal evidence is anything to go by, the number of deaths caused by the virus might be exponentially higher.', 'There is a severe shortage of medication, oxygen, hospital beds and even cremation facilities in major cities across India. The system is at breaking point. On Sunday, the seven-day average of active cases stood at 321,263, with daily new positives in excess of 350,000. If these were the official numbers and the IPL was being staged in the UK, it would have already been shut down. The last edition of the IPL, played in the United Arab Emirates, would have suffered a similar fate.', 'But in India things work differently. There are certain cash cows that cannot be criticised, but even more protected are the holy cows, such as the IPL. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is run by Jay Shah, the secretary, and he reports not so much to the president of the BCCI, Sourav Ganguly, the former India captain, as to Amit Shah, the home minister of India and one of most powerful men in the country. Jay also happens to be Amit’s son.', 'This works well on a practical level, in that the BCCI has been able to create a biosecure bubble for perhaps the only domestic tournament in the world that can afford it across two months and many cities. The BCCI has also been able to secure privileges from the government of India, such as having separate check-in counters and security corridors in airports for the players and others in the IPL.', 'England not ordering IPL players home', \"England will continue to leave the participation of their players in the Indian Premier League down to personal choice despite growing unease at the tournament's continuation during the country's Covid-19 crisis.\", 'Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali, Dawid Malan, Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes, Tom and Sam Curran and Sam Billings are still at their respective franchises, with no immediate withdrawals currently expected.', 'Flying home would involve a 10-day quarantine in a government hotel upon arrival back in the UK after India was added to the government\\'s \"red list\", while the IPL\\'s biosecure arrangements are seemingly holding firm at present.\\xa0', 'With Sourav Ganguly, the BCCI president, quoted on Monday saying the IPL is \"going on as scheduled\", England\\'s approach remains to monitor the situation as regards player welfare and assist with any logistical queries that arise.', 'An England spokesperson said: \"We continue to monitor and work with the players on an individual basis. We are offering advice daily to those that seek it. Our thoughts are with the people of India during these difficult times.\" Ali Martin', 'What has been in focus during recent IPL matches is the presence at many grounds of invitees of the teams or the IPL – who have sometimes masked up and at other times not – while essential allied services, such as a neutral media reporting these games as events and beyond, were shut out.', 'On Sunday, the IPL broadcast included public service messages such as masking up and maintaining social distancing, something that had been all too absent from the time the tournament began. This had to happen. The manner in which it was solely celebrating entertainment and glory during its nightly four-hour televised pockets, while a nation outside gasped for breath and begged for life-saving medication, was tone deaf and, frankly, unsustainable.', 'But then as a public exercise, the IPL has always been remarkably good at reinventing itself.', 'And the signs are that those working on the tournament – most significantly the live broadcast – have been given the go-ahead to actually speak about something other than maximums and the latest features of the sponsored SUV on display.', 'There is also an argument that the IPL’s continuation keeps its vast audience indoors at home every evening and provides a window of normality during what is an unprecedented crisis.', 'Ultimately, however, its continuation comes down to money. The IPL generates a significant proportion of Indian cricket’s revenues – estimated at £318m this year – and this will defray expenses incurred in the last 18 months.', 'Domestic players, coaches, support staff and countless others who rely on seasonal cricket wages are waiting to be paid. The BCCI can afford to do so but only if the show goes on, it insists.', 'If it does continue, however, the results had better match the positive intentions.

  ["Ruqsana Begum: 'My story is bigger than boxing'","['The former Muay Thai world champion on arranged marriage, chronic fatigue syndrome, gym bullies and early wobbles in boxing']","['The tears of Ruqsana Begum, which splash down on the blue canvas of the ring, are not a sign of weakness. They are, instead, markers of the battles she has won over the years. As a young Bangladeshi woman from east London on her way to becoming a Muay Thai world champion, Begum endured an arranged marriage, panic attacks, depression, bullying in the gym and ravaging bouts of ME [chronic fatigue syndrome].', 'She cries during our long interview on a hazy summer afternoon in Bethnal Green but never loses her composure. Each time the former kickboxing dynamo wipes away her tears, laughs a little while saying sorry, and continues. “Those moments have led me to this moment,” she says after one poignant pause, “where I now manage to not look for approval from outside. Rather, I go inwards and find strength from within.”', 'Begum reiterates her passion for fighting and her certainty that she can still become a success in her new sport of boxing despite the odds stacked against her. “I do love it. Stepping into the ring allows you to grow because you’re putting yourself in such depths of fear. And when you overcome that there’s such a sense of accomplishment. I love that and the fact I’m constantly working towards my goal, and progressing, even if I sometimes lose.”', 'She is a petite 36-year-old, a warm and reflective woman who also has a degree in architecture. At 5ft 3in, she does not look like a fighter. And so it’s strange, at first, to reconcile the fact that the violent backdrop of Muay Thai and boxing have brought serenity into Begum’s often turbulent world.', '“I think any creative art form, whether music or dance, Muay Thai or boxing, allows you to channel emotion and express yourself,” she says. “I was fortunate to have discovered Thai boxing when I had few other opportunities to express myself. I found my passion in life and realised I was good at it. But it’s like anything in life – talent is nothing without sacrifice.', '“So when I had all those problems I didn’t blame others. I took responsibility and said: ‘OK, this is where I am. How do I move forward?’ I found the best way to heal myself is through sport. So I’m really grateful for having Muay Thai and now boxing in my life.”', 'Begum’s new book, Born Fighter, provides an absorbing insight into the obstacles she faced. It is written with Sarah Shephard and the two women, from Muslim and Jewish backgrounds, complement each other as we learn how Begum hid her passion for Thai boxing from her family for many years. She was torn between her desire to be a dutiful Muslim daughter and a darker yearning to discover her real self in the ring.', 'The KO Combat Academy, where much of the book is set, is located under an arch in a backstreet of Bethnal Green. Trains clatter overhead and it makes me think how intimidating it must have been for a teenage Bangladeshi girl to approach a gym. “The original gym was across the road,” Begum explains, “and I can’t believe I had the courage to walk in. This is now more a commercial gym whereas back then it was hardcore. It was just fighters.”', 'Bill Judd, who trained Begum to her world championship, welcomes us today. He was just as accepting, if initially surprised, when the 18-year-old Begum told him she wanted to be a fighter. She could cover the bruises on her arms and legs, which she took from kicks, but she became adept at avoiding blows to her face. And when she was marked up her sister helped her hide the damage or she pulled her hijab more closely around her face.', 'Five years later Begum was forced to abandon Muay Thai. She was coerced into an arranged marriage by her family – who meant well in adhering to the traditions of their culture. “I was 23 and it was overwhelming,” Begum recalls. “I thought: ‘Whoa, I need to take a breath because I don’t even know him.’ I felt so much pressure to go along with it so I tried to speak to my mum. She waved me away and was very dismissive. They made it clear this was going to happen.”', 'Begum stresses that her husband, a banker from east London, was not a monster. Her book’s most harrowing pages detail how she felt trapped and suffocated living with her husband’s family who expected her to do so many chores on their behalf. “I was oppressed,” she says. “I didn’t have that freedom to say: ‘I’m feeling a bit tired so I’ll do the washing in an hour.’ I was constantly trying to please them but whatever I did wasn’t enough. At the same time I’d started a high-pressure job as a trainee architect. Eventually it took a toll on me.”', 'Begum details the severe panic attacks which engulfed her after nine months. Her doctor advised her to move back to her parents. She was in a terrible state and only the eventual understanding of her parents stabilised her. What would have happened if they had insisted she return to her marriage? “I would have stood my ground and said no. But it would have been a battle to find the courage and strength – especially when I was very vulnerable. My father was in two minds. But my mum and older brother were like: ‘No, she has to go back. This is the tradition.’ I tried to explain it to my father after one of my therapy sessions. And his reaction wasn’t good. But at that point my ex-husband filed for divorce and I was thinking: ‘God, it’s the biggest relief.’ My parents understood then what I had been through.', '“I was on antidepressants for four months and completely bedridden. But I didn’t want to be on antidepressants because they numb you. The only thing I remembered enjoying was Muay Thai and so I told myself: ‘Get back to the gym.’ One day I asked my parents to drop me off when they were coming to Whitechapel to shop. I then said: ‘Actually, can you come in with me?’ I introduced them to Bill.”', 'The trainer outlined the discipline of the sport and stressed how Begum was so respectful, and respectable, in the gym. Her parents agreed she could return. But new problems soon emerged. Begum cries when she tells me how she was bullied by other female fighters at the gym.', '“It went on for five years and Bill kept saying to me: ‘Why don’t you just leave and go to another gym?’ I thought: ‘No. I don’t want to be pushed out.’ Bill hated it but his focus was on that group of girls. I wish he supported me more because I just wanted equal treatment. So it really broke my heart and that’s why I’m torn about this place. I’ve had some amazing moments here but also a lot of pain.”', 'Begum shocked everyone in 2011 by becoming a European champion in Latvia without having anyone in her corner. A Danish trainer in the crowd ran to help her when he saw Begum was on her own between rounds.', 'Over the next few years Judd worked more closely with Begum and helped her become a world champion kickboxer in 2016. In the week of her defining fight against Susanna Salmijärvi, her ME was so debilitating that Begum was stunned when she passed a medical to fight. “I was bed-bound the whole week so I said to Bill: ‘I’m too weak to even do a warm-up. Just put me in the ring. If anything happens, throw in the towel. But give me the first round so I have those two minutes to try and knock her out. This is an opportunity I’ll never get again.’ I had enough energy for two minutes which could define the rest of my life.”', 'She came close to an early knockout but her opponent got up and, at the end of a brutal fight, Begum absorbed sustained punishment. She had done just enough to become world champion and, as she says now, “It was a 10-year journey and my first thought was: ‘Thank you, God.’”', 'Her parents surprised her when they did not resist her decision to accept an offer from David Haye to switch to professional boxing in 2018. It has been difficult for Begum and she has only had two bouts as a pro boxer – both against Ivanka Ivanova. The first fight was a draw and then, in June 2019, she was hurt badly and lost a decision to her Bulgarian opponent.', '“She didn’t hurt me in the first fight and so I was shocked the second time. There was just something unusual about her that night. When I hit her there was no reaction. That freaks me out because I’ve sparred with some boys, and good pros, in Vegas. I’ve made their noses bleed and if I hit someone there’s always some reaction. But there was nothing like that in our second fight. She was like a zombie.', '“It didn’t help that she elbowed me in the first 30 seconds and my eye completely closed. Everyone wanted me to give up afterwards but I’ve followed my gut. It’s a learning curve and the only problem with boxing is that once you lose your unbeaten record it’s meant to be over. And it’s far harder being a female boxer because there are no journeywomen. Any woman that goes into boxing is a serious fighter because they wouldn’t get signed otherwise.”', 'The Covid crisis has made it even more difficult but Begum is convinced she will become a world champion boxer. She is in talks with promoters in the US and says: “I’m hopeful. I feel like my story is bigger than boxing and these challenges will make me a better fighter and a better person. For me it’s nothing new. I’ve already gone through so many challenges in a different sport and in my life.”', 'The world outside is reeling and we have our masks at the ready before we leave the gym. But it feels right that this born fighter should stretch out her hand and bump her fist lightly against mine. “Phew, it was emotional,” she says simply as she reflects on the story of her life, “but it was good.”', 'Born Fighter by Ruqsana Begum is published by Simon & Schuster']","Boxing","Sport","2020-07-29",10,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ed035534696c561b4efb885f91290d26c575d0/721_539_5421_3253/master/5421.jpg?width=1020&quality=85&fit=max&s=8cfcf0a0eb469d69a64c0fd542a6aa3a","Ruqsana Begum says she ‘can’t believe I had the courage to walk in’ to the KO Combat Academy as an 18-year-old.

Hearn’s fighter, Anthony Joshua, faces Pulev on Saturday night in the first world heavyweight title contest to take place in a bio-secure Covid-19 bubble. The curiously open and engaging nature of boxing, the most brutal and dangerous of all sports, has been even more evident this week as the fighters, managers, promoters, television crews and lowly writers have all been cooped up together in a cordoned-off section of a hotel in Wembley.', '“He’s scary,” Hearn continued after I told him how Pulev had been a quiet revelation whether talking about books or his father, psychology or his conviction that he will beat Joshua. “Every time I’ve seen him this week I’ve gone like that.”', 'Hearn bunched his knuckles in the traditional fist bump of the fight bubble. “And Pulev’s really hit me quite hard on the hand. Not violently but I’ve gone [Hearn wrings his hand]. I said: ‘Kubrat, can you stop doing that?’ He looked at me and said: ‘Ha, ha, you easy …’”', 'Hearn has hundreds of millions of pounds hinging on the outcome of this fight. If Pulev were to shock Joshua and strip him of his IBF, WBA and WBO belts he will simultaneously rip up Hearn’s intricate plans. An expected victory for the champion, in contrast, would secure a two-fight deal between Joshua and Tyson Fury, the WBC title-holder. Joshua against Fury, an all-British battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, would be a wild, compelling and insanely lucrative affair. Hearn expects the first fight to secure around 2.2m buys on pay-per-view.', 'Pulev stands in the way – but the Bulgarian’s toughness is not matched by the kind of hand speed which unsettled Joshua when he was stopped 18 months ago. Andy Ruiz Jr, dismissed as a roly-poly no-hoper, hauled himself off the Madison Square Garden canvas to blitz Joshua. The fallen champion looked battered and bemused on that crazy night in New York.', 'It says much for Joshua’s professionalism that he won the rematch in Saudi Arabia last December by opting for a more cautious strategy. He regained his titles with a wide victory on points but doubts remain because Ruiz partied harder than he prepared for that second fight – and memories of Joshua’s vulnerability have yet to fade.', 'Pulev looks lean and confident and Hearn said: “He’s a tough guy. He’s proud. But AJ is in a good place. He’s edgy, he’s nervous, which I think is a great thing because, in these fights behind closed doors, it’s easy to be five rounds in and coast a little. And with 1,000 fans there on Saturday it’s going to be even weirder than having nobody because it’s somewhere in the middle – but still more like an exhibition atmosphere behind closed doors.”', 'The unsettling truth is that this will be the opposite of an exhibition. Robert McCracken, a down-to-earth Brummie realist who has trained Joshua since the amateur days and been in the corner for all his tumultuous high and lows, spoke plainly: “It’s very tough for heavyweight boxers. They are always one punch away from disaster. But Josh’s trained long and hard. He’s taken Pulev deadly serious.”', 'McCracken nodded when asked if he agreed with Hearn’s assessment that Joshua, beneath the amiable quips, is on edge. “He is. Pulev is another top fighter with an unbelievable record – he’s only ever lost to [Wladimir] Klitschko. Very skilled, durable and tough. Josh is up against it because it’s another live challenger. They’re not hand-picked or No 15. It doesn’t work like that with big Josh.”', 'The giant shadow of Fury hangs over the event – even if the 6ft 9in WBC champion with the outrageous suits and outlandish mouth is not expected to accept Hearn’s offer to attend the fight. McCracken was pragmatic again when asked about Fury. “Heavyweight boxing is so dangerous you can’t be thinking of future opponents. You’ve got the mandatory challenger [Pulev] who’s really determined, technically good, physically strong. All Josh thinks about is Pulev. For the last six months really. He’s got to get the job done.”', 'Pulev has a terrific jab – which is so often the key to victory in boxing. But, in the bubble, Pulev revealed even more. He was intelligent and amusing company. “I win all the time,” Pulev said when confirming that he is the Jenga champion in his camp. “It’s very precise, like building, which is my second passion after boxing. I like building, I like designing, I like architecture. From when I was six years old I drew buildings.”', 'Pulev is a proud Bulgarian and he says how much he wants to beat Joshua for the sake of his country and, even more personally, for his late father, Venko. “He was a heavyweight,” Pulev said, “and he loved boxing, like crazy, like a maniac. Before me and my brother were born, he wanted his whole life to have boys who became boxing champions.”', 'Venko Pulev was married three times and he became the father to five girls before, finally, 39 years ago, his son was born. “That was me. He said: ‘Wow! I can’t believe it’. He named me Kubrat which is the name of a very old king in Bulgaria. My middle name is Venko after him. My dad had two passions: boxing and books. He was a maniac about books. We lived in our small apartment and all the walls were completely covered in books, from floor to ceiling. In those socialist days everyone had the same apartment, the same furniture, the same couch. But all our furniture was made especially for books. Ten thousand books in one apartment. Every kind of book. History, romance, boxing.”', 'There was a less literary tone when Pulev spoke of his certainty that, driven by the memories of his father, he would knock out Joshua.', 'The world champion clearly remained the king this week. While he was accommodating, Joshua was tucked away in his own bubble within the larger boxing bubble. He is protected by his management but Joshua understands that he will be alone when Pulev walks towards him in a ring full of jeopardy and uncertainty.', '“I always say Sunday morning will come, so no rush,” Joshua said with a wry smile when I asked him if the last few days of fight week were the hardest. “We’re here now. I’ve trained hard and I feel more confident than last time [the Ruiz rematch]. In Saudi, there was massive pressure. This one I have had a lot of time to work on everything. But it won’t be a walk in the park because, if I don’t take this guy deadly serious, I’m giving him a chance to beat me.”', 'Joshua had heard all the questions about Fury and their anticipated showdown in 2021. “I’ll give you the answers but please, right now, it’s solely about Kubrat Pulev. My focus is not on anyone else.”', 'In a small huddle around Joshua someone persisted and asked how he felt about Fury choosing not to be at ringside. “I don’t think too much about it. He’s a good fighter. He’s done well. Good luck to him, but Saturday night is my night.”', 'Joshua’s cagey display in the Ruiz rematch was followed soon after by Fury crushing Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in Las Vegas in February. “Yeah, but remember it took a long time for Tyson Fury to become destructive,” Joshua said. “I’ve been that destructive ever since I started boxing. But I’m just going to do the job against Pulev in the best way possible. I’m ready for a 12-round fight but if a shot lands and causes a lot of damage I will be looking to take him out. Once a killer always a killer. Certain people can’t sleep at night because they’re really tuned up for a fight but I must be a good psychopath because I’m sleeping like a baby.”', 'Boxing’s capacity for tumult soon replaced such tranquillity. Friday afternoon’s weigh-in descended into a flurry of chaos as Pulev shouted at Joshua: “Tomorrow I’m going to destroy you.” Joshua replied: “What? You? Disrespect me and I’ll show you.”', 'The fighters came nose-to-nose while, at the back of the room, Pulev’s vociferous Bulgarian entourage charged the burly line of security men. The scuffling lasted for 10 seconds before the fighters exchanged more insults.', '“They wouldn’t stop,” Hearn told me afterwards. “In the end Pulev said: ‘I respect you’ and that dampened it. But he started again. Pulev said: ‘Tomorrow I will finish you, I will end you.’ AJ wasn’t rattled. He was calm and cold.”', 'Late on Saturday night, when the bubble darkens, the black lights of the ring will frame the contrasting figures of Joshua and Pulev. All this week’s edgy laughter and noise will die away. Everyone will pause as we wait to see the heavy blows land and discover whether the heavyweight money-spinner between Fury and Joshua has been ruined or secured.', 'Joshua v Pulev is live on Sky Sports Box Office']","Anthony Joshua","Sport","2020-12-11",22.3,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97987ea4c8d49cf9b85c38559970f9984066d49/0_82_4054_2432/master/4054.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a157303a2d38020f78250ee0807a2d99","Tempers flare at the weigh-in before Anthony Joshua’s fight against Kubrat Pulev at Wembley on Saturday night.

He knows there are no guarantees where the big beasts roam, whatever his inclination to dismiss Pulev as a 39-year-old underdog expected to provide stout but unthreatening resistance to the three-belt champion.', 'House fighters, unbeaten heavyweight prospects and ring kings in full flower do lose, sometimes to unlikely opponents, because the showcase division is not a place to make easy assumptions. And that is why the examples often cited to prove that such results are upsets – from James J Braddock beating Max Baer in 1935 to Mike Tyson falling at the feet of Buster Douglas in 1990 – should come with the qualification that a left hook thrown by a selected opponent is as dangerous as one delivered by the favourite. Or a fun-loving Mexican.', 'The Joshua script is written: he beats Pulev, impressively inside the distance – or even in an exciting tear‑up – rings Tyson Fury on Saturday morning, they agree to fight at least twice in 2021 and make more money than anyone in the history of the business, sharing maybe £200m or more. Joshua, in unguarded moments, is looking beyond that scenario.', '“Who’s to say I can’t fight until I’m 38?” he asked rhetorically in a recent interview. “I don’t want to do it because I haven’t paid any bills. I want to do it because I love boxing.”', 'Boxing and Joshua will enjoy a mutual embrace only as long as he delivers for fans persuaded to invest in watching him, and they have done so in unprecedented numbers at four stadium mega-fights, in Cardiff and Wembley. It has been a spectacularly lucrative arrangement for the champion and his associates, so there will be no dissent about the long-term strategy.', 'Pulev – who has been around so long he beat Matt Skelton 10 years ago, when the Bedford man was mysteriously aged, and four years before six-fight novice Joshua ended Skelton’s career – brings gnarled credibility, a chin that has never let him down and the mien of a scarily calm bouncer. But the challenger is not part of the long-term deal. That place at the table is reserved for Fury. Forget Deontay Wilder or any of the other Americans. For now, Joshua is locked into an unsigned pact with his compatriot, one which excites fans every bit as much as when they paid to see Frank Bruno and Lennox Lewis go at it in Cardiff 27 years ago.', 'As the architect of the Joshua phenomenon, Eddie Hearn told the BBC’s Mike Costello: “Every time AJ fights, everybody should cross their fingers.”', 'Pulev is here as an unwelcome guest and, if the IBF’s mandated challenger does what Ruiz did, the sound of jaws hitting the floor will echo around Wembley Arena like a snooker ball rolling off the table at the Crucible.', 'That’s the glory and drama of heavyweight boxing. One punch can derail large chunks of an entire industry. “We go into this fight pretty much knowing the undisputed fight [against the WBC champion Fury] is there if we can get over the final hurdle,” Hearn says.', 'Hearn reckons the ppv take is up 25% since lockdown, because, “You’ve got a captive audience sitting at home on their sofas, looking for things to do. The night in is the new night out.”', 'Joshua insists he is not doing it just for the money. He loves fighting, along with the excitement of fame and a sense of achievement – but of course he’s doing it for the money. Only fools and hardcore amateurs fight for nothing. Joshua is neither.', 'The pressure that counts comes not only from the Bulgarian veteran who will try to prove my ex-boxing friend wrong, but from the expectations of those sitting at ringside and watching at home. Accidentally, perhaps, this is a big fight.', 'There were hints of the storm to come at the weigh-in when emotions spilled over between the camps, and the fighters squared up as ritual demands.', 'As Hearn relates their parting exchange, Pulev called Joshua, “a pussy”, which is a bit yesterday as jibes go, to which the big man, who was banned from the Watford manor he called his own as a wild teenager, replied: “Come over here and say it.”', 'The fight should be better than the buildup.

  ["Anthony Joshua taking Klitschko route to title defence against Pulev","['The world heavyweight champion is still sparring days before Saturday’s fight, a trick he learned from Wladimir Klitschko']","['The hours drag in the last, slow week of a world heavyweight title fight and Anthony Joshua has been sparring at night as a way of killing time while sharpening his final preparations.', 'The IBF, WBA and WBO belt holder faces Kubrat Pulev on Saturday and, usually, a heavyweight champion would have cut back on all forms of sparring by now, but Joshua said: “The body can get soft easy. You’ve got to stay switched on, shots coming at you, gauging distance, feeling different shots. I want someone in the ring imitating Pulev. I want to spar tonight.”', 'Joshua shook his head when asked if being cooped up in a Covid bubble had left him restless and in need of a workout in the ring. “No, we’ve always sparred [in the week of the fight]. We’ll be in a hotel somewhere and we will call one of the local gyms. It’s important to have someone beside you who can push you. It’s good for preparation.', '“I have never had a problem with sparring with anyone getting stuck in. That’s been the best way and what I’ve learned from [the former world champion] Wladimir Klitschko, which is the value of getting all the best talent into one space to challenge me as champion. Four rounds with one, four rounds with another one. I’ve been out for a year and they’ve got me tough. They’ve got me ready.”', 'Eddie Hearn, his promoter, looked briefly alarmed when Joshua casually mentioned he had been in the ring without a headguard on Wednesday night. “We did eight rounds, six with the head guard and two without,” Joshua said. “Rob McCracken [his trainer] didn’t like it. But I know what works for me and Rob manages it. We work together. I could hit the pads, but they don’t hit back. The heavy bag doesn’t move.', '“Having a live opponent in front of you, moving your legs, becomes second nature. The best thing I can do is to do what I need to replicate on Saturday. The ring here [in the hotel] is tiny so I’m going to get into the ring on Saturday and have loads of space to do my job. These things are important.”', 'McCracken has trained Joshua since he was an amateur who went on to win gold at London 2012. He made an important point when asked about Joshua taking his headguard off during sparring. “It’s for the tippy-tappy stuff,” he stressed. “When you do the open sparring the headguard’s got to stay on.”', 'McCracken is too considered a man to allow Joshua to take any unnecessary risks in the ring this close to a title fight and he said: “It’s not sparring as you think, it’s technical, touch stuff. Just to get his coordination and eye in.”', 'Joshua learned some valuable lessons from Klitschko, who defeated Pulev in a world title defence in 2014 – when Joshua also sparred with Klitschko. “It’s crazy how the universe works. I was in a camp with Wladimir and then I fought him [in 2017]. At the time I didn’t really understand the implications of the way Wladimir was training [for Pulev], but I have actually implemented some of the stuff he did in my training for this camp.”', 'Did he learn any specific lessons which will help him beat Pulev? “Definitely. Klitschko was like a heavyweight factory. He invited every heavyweight to his training camp.”', 'Joshua has been an intriguing mix this week of quiet edginess and amiable good cheer. The waiting is almost over and it seems as if his relatively unconventional if gentle sparring in these last nights of preparation has helped him.

  ["Joshua and Fury deserve to split purse of a unification fight, says Hearn","['Promoter says economic reality will dictate venue for bout', 'Joshua defends his world titles against Pulev on Saturday night']","['“I’ve always felt that, commercially, Anthony Joshua is on another planet to Tyson Fury,” Eddie Hearn said while also stressing that Britain’s two world champion heavyweights will agree to a 50-50 split of a huge purse should their planned unification fight happen next year. Hearn promotes Joshua and, during a media conference call, he inevitably set about boosting his fighter’s economic credentials before agreeing that Fury’s achievements in the ring mean that they deserve to share the proceeds.', '“You’ve only got to look at AJ’s endorsement deals and the money he makes,” Hearn said. “The reason that Tyson Fury couldn’t fight in December is that they couldn’t generate the pay-per-view money or the American TV money that AJ can. But Tyson Fury is still a huge star and if you don’t offer him 50/50 then he ain’t going to take it. Do I think he should get 50/50? Commercially, no. But achievement-wise and on recent performances? Yeah, I do.”', 'Joshua defends his IBF, WBA and WBO world titles against Kubrat Pulev at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday night. Pulev is a decent fighter, and one of boxing’s proverbial tough nuts, but Joshua is backed so heavily that momentum for a definitive showdown against Fury continues to build. Fury became the WBC champion after his crushing stoppage of Deontay Wilder in February.', '“Our job over the next couple of weeks is to get that [unification] fight in place,” Hearn said. “If AJ beats Pulev, we want to go to the governing bodies and say: ‘Deal agreed, contracts signed and this is the proposed date. Will you sanction it as an undisputed fight?’”', 'Hearn was unequivocal that calls for the fight to be held in London need to be balanced by hard-nosed economic realities. After Joshua spoke last week about his possible willingness to accept a reduced purse to fight Fury in Britain, Hearn said: “I’m more brutally honest. We’ll discuss with both management teams the opportunities that are out there in terms of site fees and money in the pot. AJ has consistently earned a lot of money and will he care less about the number in the pot than Fury? Probably. But he’s not going to do it for half the money because it sounds nice. His team is going to make the right decision for his career.”', 'The promoter suggested that “everybody” in the two camps “would prefer the fight to take place in London”.', 'He added: “ But we have to rely on revenue generated via the gate and not the revenue generated by a tourism board or by a government to bring an event like that to another country. It will probably be a 50% pay cut to do the fight in the UK and that’s how brutal it is.”', 'Hearn suggested the ideal time to stage the fight would be “the end of May”. But it is unclear whether the vaccine against Covid-19 will have been introduced successfully in the UK by then while, in the Middle East, which remains the probable location, Hearn pointed out that “you have Ramadan from April to early May.”', 'He was asked what he would do if, in an unlikely scenario, both boxers insisted that they fight in the UK. “We do it in a heartbeat. But it’s not how it works in sport and especially not in the fight game. And it shouldn’t. Everyone says Daniel Dubois quit, that he’s got no heart [after the young British heavyweight suffered a serious eye injury and chose not to continue against Joe Joyce last month]. The other argument is: ‘Actually, he could have lost his eyesight in there.’ You’re basically saying the fighter should put his health on the line without getting the maximum reward financially for that risk. If it’s close, if it’s marginal, all day long do it in the UK. But half the money shouldn’t even be considered.”', 'Hearn believes a Fury-Joshua bout would generate sufficient interest to result in a rematch. “One of those fights, in my opinion, must take place in the UK,” he said. “But, particularly the first fight, both teams will say to me: ‘Show us how this fight works, show us the finances.’ I’ll present every option to them.”', 'Before then Joshua needs to beat Pulev in front of British boxing’s first crowd of the pandemic. One thousand fans will be allowed into the arena and Hearn said he is “excited but nervous” about both the event and Saturday’s headline fight. “If anything goes wrong it affects boxing moving forward. Listen, I’m nervous about the fight. We have never seen AJ box in an environment like this – but I actually think it could suit him.

Speaking for myself, Anthony and his management team, I know how hard we’ve worked these last couple of months. I just feel that this fight is so big it’s not a difficult sell. We’ve already had approaches from eight or nine sites in the Middle East, Asia, eastern Europe and America.”', 'Hearn added: “We’d like to get a site deal confirmed in the next month. The hard part is always getting everybody to put pen to paper. But this was a major effort from all parties to get this over the line.”', 'Confirmation of a signed contract is a welcome step forward amid tortuous negotiations, but the fight is still some distance from being finalised. Hearn conceded to British reporters last week that Fury and Joshua could still walk away from their signed contracts if they are dissatisfied with the venue and size of their purse, which they will split on a 50-50 basis for the first fight.', '“This is the biggest fight in boxing and one of the biggest sporting events in the world,” Hearn said. “It will be a major, major win for a country that wants to showcase itself.”', 'Saudi Arabia is expected to offer the kind of outrageous money needed to secure the fight as staging a sporting contest of this magnitude fits the idea that the country’s poor record on human rights can be smoothed by “sportswashing” – where staging a global event presents a more positive image to the world.', 'Last week Hearn told the British fight press that a counter offer might emerge from Las Vegas but, with no guarantee on the size of a crowd owing to the pandemic, it is hard to see how even the giant US casinos can match a bid from the Middle East. Hearn also admitted the only way the fight could be held in Britain was if a crowd of 100,000 could attend – “and that seems impossible”.', 'Hearn’s announcement of the contract being signed comes just four days after Fury claimed that, as the fight against Joshua was “nowhere near” to being finalised, he had stopped training and was drinking heavily.', '“Until I’ve got a date and a load of money in my pocket, there’s no fight,” Fury said in a bizarre video. “A lot of things behind the scenes can scupper a fight like that. We’re nowhere near at the moment. I’ve stopped training now, I’m on holiday. I’m doing anything between 10 to 12 pints of lager a day.”', 'Those close to Fury’s camp offer a very different view. They insist he is in training while last week Hearn said: “I don’t know whether Tyson was in a bad mood or pulling everyone’s plonker. What I do know is everyone has put a lot of work into this deal and he is on board.”', 'The fact that Fury and Joshua have at least signed the contract supports Hearn’s claim.

Fury then responded by calling his rival a “big ugly dosser” and suggesting he was “no talk, no action”.', 'Hearn was more upbeat, however, saying a contract for the fight was close, even though Fury is yet to agree terms. “From our perspective and AJ’s perspective, we’re ready to go,” he said. “From Tyson Fury’s perspective, they’ve got a couple of lawyers across it from their point.', '“There’s no reason why it shouldn’t happen this week. We’re not far away from their side and it is inevitable, but at the same time we’ve got to close the door on it.”', 'After confirming the fight would be staged in Saudi Arabia, Hearn said his preference was for it to take place on 14 August. “You’ve got the Olympics finishing on 7 August, so in terms of a global spectacle it would make sense to go on the 14th.

Stenson has not had any notion to strike a ball since.', '“I don’t feel the rush to practise and play,” the Swede says. “Five weeks out is when I’ll start digging in hard because I’ll have something on the horizon. I want to be ready and prepared when we get the go-ahead because this is going to impact so many things in this sport.”', 'But out from when? The Masters is postponed, as is the US PGA Championship. The staging of the US Open in June remains a long-shot and the Open a month later is shrouded in doubt.', '“Once we started the Players I expected us to finish but everything happened so quickly,” Stenson says. “You only need one person to be sick at a tournament and you have all sorts of implications. I have no issues at all with the decision.', '“If I am going to find some small positive, I have to go back to 2003-2004 for the last time I had a nine-10 week off season. This one is obviously not intended but I have to try to use the time as best I can. I’ll focus on workouts and doing some fun stuff you don’t get to do otherwise; cleaning the garage, cleaning closets. There’s always things to do and things to accomplish, right?”', 'Stenson cherished golf’s return to the Olympic scene as he collected silver in Rio. If postponement of the Tokyo Games was inevitable, it still stung the 43-year-old.', '“Both as an experience but also as my last chance to get another or a better medal,” he says. “The Olympics and Ryder Cup were highlights looking at 2020.”', 'At least the Olympic scenario is relatively clear cut. “I have played two full tournaments in the PGA Tour season so what about the FedEx Cup and qualifying for the play-offs?” Stenson asks. “Some guys have played 15 events. How do you tackle all that if you start playing in June or July? I am exempt through next year on the PGA Tour, so it doesn’t really matter for playing privileges, but for some guys that’s a big thing.”', 'Could the Ryder Cup become the sole domain of picks? “No matter what you do there, it’s going to be unfair to some. Tyrrell Hatton who won in Turkey and won at Bay Hill. Can you go to picks and – this is hypothetical, clearly – a captain feels he doesn’t fit into the 12? Someone could go from a lock to not in the team.”', 'Stenson is a former Open champion, a past recipient of the FedEx Cup’s $10m bonus and a Ryder Cup stalwart. It is something of cliche to suggest sportspeople of his level are out of touch with reality and, in Stenson’s case, completely unfair. He acknowledges the gravity of this pandemic.', '“There’s a lot of fun stuff available for the kids and for us here [at the family home in Florida] but I’m not sure I should mention that when you have someone locked in an apartment and can’t go outside,” Stenson says. “It’s disastrous on a global level from people being really sick to losing their lives, to the world economy plummeting. Anyone who lives paycheque to paycheque is going to feel this. Everyone will to a degree but it feels corny if I am going to complain when people are losing their jobs.', '“They say you might have no or very mild symptoms but who wants to roll the dice on that? I’ve had normal flu three times and felt like garbage by a multiple of 10. Once was before the 2014 Masters, I was in bed for nine days with a high fever. On a hot first day at Augusta, I almost fell into Rae’s Creek walking off the 13th green. My caddie had to steer me by the arm towards the tee. Another time I was in an emergency room, convinced I was going to die. If you can feel even worse from this, it won’t be a fun ride at all. People are in grave danger. This is nasty.”', 'Stenson’s coach, Pete Cowen, tested positive after returning from the Players. “He picked it up on his travels, from what I understand,” Stenson says. “I hope and believe he wasn’t contagious when I last saw him. I think he will get through it but he has been feeling pretty bad.”', 'That Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm have dismissed the breakaway Premier Golf League spells the end to some but Stenson suggests tales of PGL’s demise are premature.', '“They are still here, trying to make what they believe is the best product for golf,” he says. “For as long as I can remember, people complain the fields aren’t strong enough. You can’t have the top 30 guys on each tour playing 44 times in a year, it just isn’t doable.', '“There are a number of things I like about this concept, one is the best players competing against each other on a much more regular basis. I also think golf would really benefit from a proper off-season, without feeling when you have your own time off that you are missing out because others are playing.', '“Whether we end up there in the short-term or long-term I couldn’t tell you but I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up there at one point.”']","Henrik Stenson","Sport","2020-03-29",19,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6150d70f6a30d72fbe326c5a0f9ca2a0de87f338/0_153_4564_2738/master/4564.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=06a8bed164f2e12bc9c998aff1dd3b61","Henrik Stenson last played at the Players Championship, which was abandoned after the first round, on 12 March.

  ["Autumn Masters in Augusta’s sights after coronavirus forces postponement","['Augusta hope to stage tournament in September or October']","['Augusta National hopes it can break with tradition and host the Masters in autumn, after the first major of the year became another high-profile sporting victim of the coronavirus outbreak.', 'Fred Ridley, Augusta’s chairman, announced on Friday that the Masters had been postponed and expressed a wish to hold the tournament over new dates. That Tiger Woods is due to defend his title renders the next, and 84th, Masters highly significant.', 'Augusta came under pressure after the PGA Tour cancelled its marquee event, the Players Championship, with just one round played. The Valspar Championship, World Golf Championship Match Play and Texas Open were also removed from the schedule. There were tentative noises that the Masters, which had been set to start on 9 April, could be played without spectators but the outcome was instead firmer.', '“Unfortunately, the ever-increasing risks associated with the widespread coronavirus Covid-19 have led us to a decision that undoubtedly will be disappointing to many, although I am confident is appropriate under these unique circumstances,” said Ridley. “Considering the latest information and expert analysis, we have decided at this time to postpone the Masters Tournament, the Augusta National Women’s Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals.', '“Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision. We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date.”', 'The Masters has been staged in April in all but two years. In 1934 – at the inaugural tournament – and 1939 it was played in March. There was no Masters between 1943 and 1945, with the course hosting cattle to assist with the US war effort.', 'September or October have initially been mooted as potential slots for 2020 but the crowded golf calendar, including a Ryder Cup this year, render any such switch highly complicated. The summer climate in Georgia rules that period out. As things stand the other three majors – the US PGA Championship, US Open and Open Championship – are scheduled to go ahead as planned but there is obvious and considerable doubt attached to them.', '“I’m not surprised, not surprised at all,” said Paul Casey, the world No 24 of Augusta’s actions. “This is now a pandemic. The ladies and gentlemen that run that great event have very smart minds and are taking the right precautions. I think we as a collective in the golf community felt that we were taking the necessary precautions and it was important to continue. But obviously it got to a tipping point and we realised that that’s not the right thing to be doing.”', 'Justin Thomas, a former US PGA winner, added: “I felt like there was no chance we were going to play the Masters. It’s so soon.”', 'The Tour’s decision to suspend standard events was also widely welcomed by players. Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour’s commissioner, initially announced a plan to complete the closing 54 holes of the Players Championship and three subsequent tournaments behind closed doors. The model swiftly changed to total lockdown.', '“Of course it’s the right decision,” said the world No 1, Rory McIlroy. “If in a few weeks’ time this dies down and everything is OK, it’s still the right decision.', '“I’ve got no golf to play coming up. I was supposed to have my coach, Michael Bannon, fly out next week and we were going to spend some time together, and that’s probably not going to happen, him coming from Ireland. I’ll probably just spend some time at home, evaluate the situation, and see where we go.”', 'As Monahan addressed the media on Friday morning, the toll this scenario had taken on him was visible. “Ultimately there were some players that were concerned [about continuing with the Players],” Monahan said. “That’s something that we took into consideration and took very seriously.', '“As we step back and we think about when we’re going to play, we need to do all the things that led us to this decision. We need to continue to understand what’s happening on the ground in the markets where we would be returning to play, continue to work with our partners in those markets, continue to understand what’s happening with the CDC and the World Health Organisation, and then ultimately that will guide our decision. We’re going to make sure that we protect the safety and wellbeing of all of our constituents as we make that decision.”', 'Monahan confirmed 50% of the Players prize fund, $7.5m, will be paid out equally to competitors. Eighteen holes at Sawgrass on Thursday, therefore, earned these individuals around $52,000 each.']","The Masters","Sport","2020-03-13",20.25,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b85ea7c9494e643a517bf4a8ffd7a42974f6d8/0_354_5289_3173/master/5289.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8c2f20bfb03994f5aeb4befd244b2762","The Masters has been postponed.

  ["Hideki Matsuyama is Japanese but his victory matters for Asian Americans","['The Masters champion appears to have little in common with Asian Americans. But his win comes at a time when any Asian success story is welcome in the US']","['And with that, Hideki Matsuyama is the first male Japanese player ever to win a golf major.', 'Quite interesting timing, particularly as anti-Asian hate crimes in the US have risen 150% over the past year, spurred on by conspiracy theories – spread by those in power – about the origins of Covid-19. The hashtag ‘Stop Asian Hate’ surged more than 5,000% just this past month, according to Google Trends.', 'What does Matsuyama’s win have to do with America? At first, I contemplated this and thought: “nothing”. He is from Japan, with absolutely no ties to North America – outside of his Oakley sponsor. Many Asian Americans may feel more of a kinship with Tiger Woods than with Matsuyama, but then again, almost five other racial identities do as well.', 'Parallels can be drawn to when Yao Ming first arrived in 2002, or when Jeremy Lin rose to prominence during Linsanity in 2012. During Yao’s time in the NBA, most Asian Americans saw no commonality with a 7ft 6in giant from a country that might as well have been from another solar system culturally. I, for one, cheered on Shaquille O’Neal when Yao was matched up against him. Like many other Asian Americans, I felt more in touch with an underdog who had a somewhat similar origin of growing up in California than someone who was essentially groomed as a young child to become China’s national marvel. (Speaking to how out of touch America was just two decades ago, don’t forget that the Heat somehow thought it was a great PR move to pass out 8,000 fortune cookies to fans during Yao’s first game in Miami. Fortune cookies do not originate from China, and actually came from 19th century Japan.)', 'Some of us do ponder if Matsuyama’s win may actually encourage more animosity against Asians, specifically in the US. Much of golf’s American audience is white and conservative, from areas where there are few Asians. For some of them, seeing someone other than a white man in a green jacket may cause resentment – after all, it’s not like everyone was happy when Woods started his era of dominance among the country club set.', 'But we should put those worries aside. The first generation of Asian Americans came to this country to give a better life for the following generations. In order for all Americans to live in a country of compassion and acceptance, we must push forwards more minority-driven narratives. At the end of the day, it really does not matter if Matsuyama was raised American or western culturally. What really matters is seeing people of color doing great things. We need to get to the point where it is natural to see lead characters in films, or dominant athletes, coming from all backgrounds.', 'Over the course of the year, news outlets have started to turn more attention to hate crimes and racism against Asians. Many cable news channels have started to bring in Asian influencers and activists to continue the conversation. No doubt, this would have just been part of the news cycle, and the shows would soon have moved on to other ‘newsworthy’ subject matter.', 'Instead, came the domestic terrorism shootings in Georgia – the same state, incidentally, where Matsuyama won the Masters – which thrust the topic into the national spotlight, and a domino effect started.', 'The model minority stereotype has been thrust aside, at least momentarily, as Asian Americans from all walks of life have fought back publicly against racism. An Ohio politician named Lee Wong, sick of people questioning whether he is American, removed his shirt during a town meeting and showed a deep scar that he suffered while serving in the US Army and asked: “Is this patriot enough?” A 75-year-old Chinese woman, who was attacked in San Francisco and bravely fought off her assailant, donated all of the funds raised for her – just under $1m – back into the Asian-American community to fight racism.', 'As sad as it sounds, one has to wonder had this pandemic and the Georgia shootings not occurred, would the Asian American community continue to be ignored? What outsiders always seem to forget is that Asian Americans differ drastically in cultural terms – we are Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Burmese, Vietnamese … the list goes on. Yet the one thing that holds us all together is the same meaningless taunt of “Go back to China!” or “You don’t belong here”. The only thing we as a community can do collectively is continue to celebrate Asian success stories like Matsuyama’s, no matter how rarely they come – and even if they’re from someone we seem to have little in common with.

  ["Hideki Matsuyama holds nerve to become Masters champion","['Final round of 73 enough to secure Green Jacket', 'Matsuyama becomes first Japanese male major winner']","['One can only assume Hideki Matsuyama did not feel the heavy burden of history at all. There is no other reasonable explanation for the manner in which the 29-year-old won the 85th edition of the Masters. Matsuyama has become the first Asian-born player to don a Green Jacket and the only Japanese male to win a major.', 'His is a victory that will reverberate far beyond this exclusive corner of Georgia. Positive impacts for golf as a whole, it can only be hoped, will follow. A nation that has long since developed an affinity with this sport belatedly has its idol. The Green Jackets, who regard themselves as progressives these days, will be giddy with excitement at the expansion of their roll of honour into fresh territory. A global game needs global stars, after all.', 'Matsuyama’s 10 under par secured the first major of 2021 by one shot from Will Zalatoris. Jordan Spieth closed in a share of third with Xander Schauffele at minus seven.', 'It was just a pity that a vast Japanese media contingent, who ordinarily would track Matsuyama’s every move, were not on site. Covid has denied them first-hand accounts of the moments they have pursued for so long and would have treasured. A cruel sporting fate.', 'Brief worry for the champion arrived with a bogey at the 1st. As Zalatoris collected a shot up ahead at the 2nd – the debutant had also hit birdie on the opening hole – Matsuyama’s lead was just a shot.', 'The response set the tone for the rest of Matsuyama’s day. He comfortably shot birdie on the par-five 2nd and did likewise on the final two holes of the front nine. Matsuyama marched down the 10th with a five-shot lead. Not even the perils associated with Amen Corner could deny him from here, surely.', 'Matsuyama did make a bogey after playing his tee shot at the 12th into a bunker. The damage was immediately repaired with a birdie at the 13th. All the while, no one from the chasing pack was making sufficient inroads for the champion-elect to fret. The key period of this Masters actually arrived after a 75-minute weather delay on Saturday, with Matsuyama emerging to play his back nine in six under par. This afforded a level of leeway and comfort the world No 25 could lean on during the final day. Whisper it, but large chunks of the denouement were anti-climactic.', 'The finding of water at the 15th drew a groan but little more, given Matsuyama was four ahead of Schauffele, his playing partner. Schauffele almost holed out from the greenside bunker for an eagle but Matsuyama was able to ensure 12 under played 10 under.', 'Schauffele was now the key threat; he had now had four birdies in a row. Disaster followed for the world No 6, who found water from the tee at the par-three 16th and fired his third shot over the green. Matsuyama could exhale. A bogey for the Japanese was fine in context of Schauffele’s six.', 'Zalatoris is due immense credit for his display. Not since Fuzzy Zoeller in 1979 has a player won the Masters first time out. Zalatoris didn’t manage that but the strength he displayed to stay so prominent points towards brighter days. A Sunday 70 confirmed the best finish of his professional career and rendered him the first Masters rookie to be runner-up since 1982. Zalatoris was born in 1996.', 'Spieth will contemplate what might have been. His bogey at the 1st denied the opportunity for the momentum desperately needed. Still, and typically, the resurgent Texan fought on; from a tournament aggregate of three under after eight he finished four shots better. Another major title, you feel, is not far away.', 'Justin Rose, who appeared to be battling technical issues all weekend, slipped to a closing 74 for seventh place. Patrick Reed and Corey Conners closed one shy of Rose’s total. Robert MacIntyre’s 72 and level-par aggregate was enough to secure him top-12 finish and, therefore, an invitation back to Augusta in 2022. Fine work for the Scottish debutant.', 'Jon Rahm’s 66 earned him tied fifth with Marc Leishman. “Each day I played better golf,” Rahm said. “First three days I just couldn’t get anything going. Today was the complete opposite. Started the way I started and that set the tone for the rest of the round.', '“I’m happy. It’s still a top five at a major with a great round on a Sunday. I think that’s 15 straight rounds of even par or better here. Clearly I like the place, I play good here. My year is coming up. Let’s hope it’s soon.”', 'Rahm had left the premises long before Matsuyama took on the kind of scenario of which golfers dream. On the 72nd hole of the tournament he first played in as an amateur a decade ago, all Matsuyama had to do was place one foot in front of the other. A bogey mattered not.', '“He’s just a great player,” said Charl Schwartzel, who won that 2011 Masters. “He has shown us all over the last 10 years that, when he gets going, he’s a guy that feeds off confidence. He sets high expectations. But as you saw yesterday after the rain delay, that’s how Hideki plays when he’s got confidence, straight at every flag, and he seems to pull them off too.” In the time-honoured words of Alphaville; big in Japan, all right.']","The Masters","Sport","2021-04-12",0.13,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70e066da32b169fe0830d43e4ad2937c105f4d92/0_21_2955_1773/master/2955.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=85be76dc7e50dda5ec8acb4a10745f19","Hideki Matsuyama celebrates in the Green Jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta.

Although destined for a missed cut anyway, Matthew Wolff was disqualified on Friday evening having signed for a lower score than he had delivered at the 17th hole of his second round.', '“Obviously I wanted to be around for the weekend,” Johnson said. “I like this golf course. I feel like I play it very well. I just didn’t putt very good. It’s pretty simple. Six three-putts in two rounds, you just can’t do that,” he continued. “Obviously I didn’t drive it great but drove it good enough, and I felt like I never was really too bad out of position, just the three-putts killed me. You take all the three-putts away, I’m one under. That was kind of the difference. I just didn’t putt very well.”', 'Koepka’s scenario can be readily explained by the undergoing of knee surgery just last month. Not that the four-times major winner was placated by extenuating circumstance. “How disappointed do you think I am?” Koepka asked. “I worked my ass off just to get here and then to play like this is pretty disappointing.”', 'Koepka, who matched Johnson’s score, suggested he may not play competitively again before the next major of the year. The US PGA Championship takes place at Kiawah Island in late May.', '“I wouldn’t have been playing for another month if it wasn’t this week,” he added. “So I’ll take a nice long break after this. Way I look at it, I have two more days to do rehab that I probably wouldn’t get if I was out here, and I’ll get ready for the PGA.”', 'García missed the cut by one, largely due to a Thursday 76; the 2017 champion signed for 72 in the second round. “I think I played great,” he said. “It’s just hard to know what to say. I felt like the way I played today, I should have never shot more than two or three under par. That should have been my worst score, and somehow, I don’t know why, it just wouldn’t happen. I couldn’t shoot one more shot than I shot today, the way I played.”', 'McIlroy, who hadn’t missed an Augusta cut since his second Masters appearance of 2010, did not appear for post-round media duties.

By close of play, Jordan Spieth had appeared in Rose’s rearview mirror like the kind of old friend you smile at while wishing they were somewhere else entirely.', 'In 2015, Rose tried to chase down Spieth on a Masters Sunday and failed. While the scenario is, for now, entirely different – Rose holds the advantage and there are 36 holes to play – Spieth is striding forward as golf’s redemption man. That he is within touching distance of Rose’s lead, days after a first tournament victory in almost four years, feels hugely significant.', 'Does Spieth allow himself to believe he can win? Too right, he does. “I came in thinking that,” he said. “I’m in position now to think that, for sure. At the halfway point, I would have been pleased with being two back.', '“I’m happy that the golf course has the opportunity to play more and more difficult over the weekend. I’m looking forward to that kind of challenge and I think that could be an advantage to me if I’m in control of the ball.” Spieth seemed perfectly aware that gusting winds are in Saturday afternoon’s forecast.', 'It is hardly being cruel to Rose to point out the will of most neutral observers will be for Spieth to claim a second Masters come Sunday evening in this iconic corner of Georgia. Yet such outcomes still feel a long way off. Rose, at seven under par, leads by one from Will Zalatoris and Brian Harman. Spieth has joined Marc Leishman at minus five.', 'Rory McIlroy was among those to miss the Augusta cut, the first time the Northern Irishman has suffered such ignominy here since 2010. Brooks Koepka also exited stage left after providing unwanted reference to The Best of the Connells (on the basis such a thing exists): 74-75.', 'That Rose shot level par belies the full story of his day. Having started the second round with a four-shot lead, the Englishman handed three strokes back to the course by the 8th tee. At the 6th, a 67ft Rose putt lacked sufficient gusto to negotiate a hill and rolled back to his feet. He remained at minus four, and by this point tied with Bernd Wiesberger, until a birdie at the 13th. Rose picked up further shots at the 14th and 16th in hauling himself back to the aggregate position he had teed off at. A 72, of course, lacked the fireworks of his first-round 65 but Rose, such a fierce competitor, stood firm when it would have been easy to wilt.', '“I think it was just a classic day at Augusta National when you’re just slightly off,” Rose explained. “You can be a foot or two out on certain occasions and you end up struggling. I think maybe off the back of yesterday, it starts to feel pretty different pretty quickly.', '“I had a word with myself on the 8th tee. I just changed my mindset a little bit at that point and started to play match play against the golf course. I scratched a line on my scorecard and told myself I was three down, could I go ahead and beat the golf course from that point on? I had a putt on 18 to win my match 1up, but unfortunately it just slipped by. An honourable draw.” As Rose knows only too well, the Masters demands a victor.', 'Spieth dropped just a single shot during his 68. Birdies at the 2nd, 10th, 13th, 15th and 17th endorsed his new-found confidence. Leishman posted 67 from the morning wave. Zalatoris’s 68 and Harman’s 69 were delivered late in the day.', 'Justin Thomas, whose claims on this event looked stronger than anybody’s before a ball was struck, sat alongside Spieth at five under until a mishap at the last. Thomas lipped out for par from 7ft, turning a 66 into a 67. Thomas has Tony Finau, Kim Si-woo, Cameron Champ, Hideki Matsuyama and Wiesberger for company at minus four.', 'Bryson DeChambeau showed he has grit to match his eccentricity with a 67 – nine strokes better than he managed on Thursday. At one under par, it would be foolish to rule out Masters glory for the reigning US Open champion. From the course he headed to the range, battering drive after drive until darkness drew near. His is a relentless pursuit.', '“You have to experience failure in order to understand what success is,” DeChambeau said. “It’s just not realistic to have success all the time. That’s what’s so great about this golf course.”', 'That José María Olazábal survived the cut was stunning. The Spaniard, who won here in 1994 and 1999, hadn’t played competitive golf since struggling at the last Masters in November. There, he signed for 78 and 80. The 55-year-old returned to add a 71 to Thursday’s 75, thereby squeezing into the final 36 holes for the first time since 2014.', '“It’s like winning the event,” said a beaming Olazabal. “I enjoyed the two days. Obviously, because I hit the ball better but because of the conditions on the golf course. It’s lovely to see Augusta played like we have the last two days, fast and firm. It reminds me a lot of the late ‘80s and ‘90s.” On what would have been Seve Ballesteros’s 64th birthday, there was poignancy attached to that comment.']","The Masters","Sport","2021-04-10",0.12,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f632904a795ba2017e9bb52d379eeb8e235f30d8/41_186_3917_2352/master/3917.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e3830acd1cf5d70cfb7d048d57c8350c","Justin Rose is happy after putting on the 18th for a 72 to add to his opening 65, to hold a one-shot lead at the halfway point of the Masters.

  ["Paul Casey and Tiger Woods among old guard leading the way at the Masters","['Casey is clubhouse leader on 65, Woods and Westwood post 68', 'Three-hour rain delay meant full round was not completed']","['Father Time was perhaps riled by the domination of pre-Masters discussion of what athleticism and equipment – or, to be precise, Bryson DeChambeau – may do to Augusta National. Sixteen years have passed since Paul Casey tied sixth on his Masters debut. Tiger Woods first competed at Augusta National two and a half decades ago. As DeChambeau battled swing demons – not entirely unsuccessfully, it must be said – Casey strode to the top of the leaderboard, with Woods in close pursuit.', 'Casey’s 65 included five birdies and an eagle. It represented a 16-stroke improvement from his first Masters round of 2019. In truth, the latter performance is an anomaly in context of his strong Augusta record. A more pertinent reference point appears the Englishman’s second place in this summer’s US PGA Championship; but Georgia was always on his mind.', '“This is something I’ve looked forward to,” Casey explained. “I was vocal earlier in the year about not enjoying golf in a pandemic. I’m acutely aware that I’m in a very fortunate position. I still get to be a professional golfer and play championship golf, but I didn’t know how the fan-less experience would be. So far, I’ve not enjoyed it and I felt the lack of energy. I’ve had nothing or very little to draw from, being out playing tournament golf.', '“The Masters, though … this week, it still has a buzz to it. There’s an energy and a little bit of a vibe. Yes, it’s clearly a lot less than what we are used to but there’s something about this place. I felt excited to be here. I’ve never been so happy to pass a Covid test, just to get in.', '“With the history of this championship, this tournament. So many people like myself are just excited to play this. This is a treat. It always has been and always will be a real treat.”', 'At 43, Casey is seeking the maiden major win that would haul his career into fresh territory. At 44, Woods is now in hot pursuit of a sixth Green Jacket. The defending champion’s chances heading into this event were seen as remote; how Woods silenced the naysayers with a wonderfully composed 68. Incredibly, this marked just his second sub-70 opening Masters round.', 'By Woods’s own calm assessment: “I did everything well.” There was, though, time to reflect on the value of Augusta experience. “I think that understanding how to play this golf course is so important,” he added. “I’ve been lucky enough to have so many practice rounds throughout my career with so many past champions, and I was able to win this event early in my career and build myself up for the understanding that I’m going to come here each and every year.', '“So understanding of how to play it is a big factor and it’s one of the reasons why early in my career that I saw Jack [Nicklaus] contending a lot, I saw Raymond [Floyd] contending late in his career, now Bernhard Langer and Freddie Couples always contend here late in their careers. Just understanding how to play this golf course is a big part of it.”', 'DeChambeau’s first four holes included two provisional balls, pine straw, Rae’s Creek, a bush, a penalty drop and a fluffed chip. He was two over par taking to the 14th, his fifth, tee. The ghosts of MacKenzie and Jones looked to be in play. To his credit – and in emphasising his level of talent – the Californian rallied to the point where he signed for a 70. “I am fortunate to be two under par,” he admitted. He spent most of the day fighting a hook which will need to be eliminated if he is to contend for the Green Jacket.', 'Casey’s lead is two, from Xander Schauffele and Webb Simpson. Justin Thomas, who has played only 10 holes, is also five under. Lee Westwood, Hideki Matsuyama, Louis Oosthuizen and Patrick Reed matched Woods’s 68.', 'A three-hour delay, caused by a forecast thunderstorm that duly hit Augusta in the morning, meant a host of players must return to complete their first rounds on Friday. Rory McIlroy is level at the turn with Dustin Johnson, one of the Northern Irishman’s playing partners, on three under. Thomas birdied his first three holes in serving notice that he was rightly among the Masters favourites; he collected a shot at the hazardous 10th immediately before the horn blew.', 'Nicklaus and Gary Player had undertaken ceremonial starting duties shortly before the delay. Nicklaus created something of a storm before the US presidential election when offering strong support for Donald Trump. Naturally, the 18-times major winner was asked if he now had any follow-up comments. Naturally his reply was curt. “I think I’ve said enough about that. I don’t think this is the place for politics.”', 'Nicklaus did, though, share an endearing tale relating to his time in the Crow’s Nest, Augusta’s standard lodgings for amateur players, during the 1959 Masters. “We had Phil Rodgers, Deane Beman, Ward Wettlaufer, Tommy Aaron and myself,” Nicklaus recalled. “We all stayed there. That’s not a very big place, if you happen to go look at it, for five guys. One bathroom, one shower. But we all stayed there, and of course Phil and I were the big eaters at the time.', '“The amateurs had to be charged for their food, so they charged us a dollar for breakfast, a dollar for lunch and two dollars for dinner. Phil and I, generally speaking, would have two steaks at night. They came to us after a couple nights and they said: ‘Gentlemen, you’re abusing the thing with eating two steaks, we’re going to have to charge you $2 apiece.’ I said: ‘That’ll be quite all right.’” Simpler times.']","The Masters","Sport","2020-11-13",0.1,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66cdadaa997e18dba85fdb64efe6f4b9fe8a5282/70_176_5145_3087/master/5145.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7df59268f1cd0344e0989ff6969c52ba","Paul Casey works on his grip while Patrick Reed’s caddie, Kessler Karain, lines up a putt for his man on the 5th green.

The Scuderia endured their worst result of the season at Spa-Francorchamps, with Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel both finishing outside the points. However, Binotto has denied that the team are in crisis.', 'Their slump in performance has been directly attributed to a reduction in engine power after questions over its legality last season led to an investigation and subsequent rule clarification from the FIA. Red Bull’s team principal, Christian Horner, said in Spa that the process had left a “sour taste” and had potentially denied his team victories in 2019.', 'Lewis Hamilton won at Spa with a dominant, trouble-free run from pole to flag. His teammate Valtteri Bottas finished second, with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen third. Ferrari, who have won the previous two meetings in Belgium, were well off the pace all weekend. Leclerc and Vettel qualified in 13th and 14th and finished in 14th and 13th respectively. They spent just five of the 44 laps with a car inside the top 10. ', 'Clearly down on power, the Ferraris could not compete on the straights and Leclerc said it was difficult to make a pass even with DRS. Vettel was overtaken by Kimi Räikkönen in a Ferrari customer-engined Alfa Romeo and who finished in 12th.', '“We are disappointed and angry, as indeed are our fans and with good reason,” said Binotto. “It’s a difficult moment in a season that we knew from the start would be a tough one, but it’s at times like this that we need to stand firm and look ahead in order to get over this difficult period. It’s the only way we will get out of this situation.”', 'Ferrari have struggled for power since the FIA investigated their engine and instituted rules relating to the fuel flow toward the end of last year. Ferrari were not penalised, however, and the FIA did not release their findings, instead coming to a controversial private settlement with the team.', 'On the power-dependent straights of Spa the shortcomings of the new engine were writ large. Their car is also draggy and the team struggled with switching their tyres on at the circuit, compounding their lack of pace.', 'At the previous two meetings Ferrari completely dominated in Belgium and other teams have interpreted the fall-off in performance as indicative of just how large an advantage their previous engine configuration was giving them last year.', '“The whole thing has left quite a sour taste,” said Horner. “Obviously, you can draw your own conclusions from Ferrari’s current performance. There are races we should have won last year arguably if they had run with an engine that seems to be quite different to last year.”', 'Red Bull were third, 87 points behind Ferrari in the 2019 constructors’ championship.', 'Ferrari face a further turbulent two weeks. They go into a double header of home races starting next weekend at Monza, immediately followed by the first F1 race at the circuit owned by the team at Mugello, which will also be the first race this season to host a limited number of fans.', 'Binotto insisted his team were handling the pressure calmly. “It is wrong to use the word ‘crisis’ for the moment we are going through,” he said. “We all take responsibility for this situation.

I lost my balance. I had nothing left at the end. All my form went out of the window. I ran like an amateur, I cannot believe it, I came so close, this was such a good chance. My body feels good, I ran well through the heats. I let it go.”', 'His time of 20.03sec was a season’s best. But it was painfully short of the American Noah Lyles, who celebrated his first world title after coming home in a modest 19.83 sec. Short of the Canadian Andre De Grasse, who took silver in 19.95. And short of the Ecuadorian Alex Quinonez, who came home in 19.98.', '“I am sorry, I feel like I have let down so many people,” admitted Gemili. “So many people sent me messages. The team know I have been plagued with injuries.”', 'Gemili has had this feeling before. At the 2016 Rio Olympics he finished fourth in the 200m final, three thousands of a second away from bronze.', '“It’s the same, if not worse than that feeling after Rio because of the story behind it, where I’ve come from after injuries and being written off completely.', '“To not break 20 seconds is so disappointing and heartbreaking. I had the medal and it slipped out of my hands. Fourth is the same as eighth, the same as 16th. Unless you’re on the podium, who cares?”', 'Still, at least Gemili ended on an upbeat note. “It hasn’t happened today, but it has relit something inside me,” he said. “If I go to Tokyo it’s winnable.”', 'It means that Britain still only has one medal after five days of competition. However Dina Asher-Smith is a penalty kick away from gold in the 200m after yet another potential rival, Elaine Thompson, was ruled out through injury. It means that only four of the top 10 in the world will be in Wednesday’s final – with Asher-Smith fastest of all.', '“Dina is going to win,” predicted Gemili. “This is the best opportunity for a female sprinter to win a medal. She’s miles apart from everyone. It’s not about if she’s going to win it, it’s about how fast she can go. I’m hoping she can do something really special.”', 'Elsewhere there was an easy victory in the 800m for the Nike Oregon Project athlete Donavan Brazier in a US record 1:42.34, ahead of the Bosnian Amel Tuka and the Kenyan Ferguson Cheruiyot Rotich.', 'When Brazier was asked what he knew about Alberto Salazar’s doping ban, he surprised his audience by telling them: “I didn’t actually know the investigation was going on. And he’s not my coach - I’m coached by Pete Julian.”', 'When some put it to him that what had happened might have changed his opinion of Salazar he shook his head. “No. The only contact I’ve had with Alberto has been pleasant. I like Alberto. He’s a cool guy.”', 'And when asked if he would stay with the Oregon Project, he added: “Yeah, if Pete takes control.”', 'Meanwhile a thrilling men’s pole vault competition was won by the American Sam Kendricks, who cleared 5.97m to defeat the Swedish teen sensation Mundo Duplantis to gold.']","World Athletics Championships","Sport","2019-10-01",21.54,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fdf62f54cef0eab06215f3dbc7d8249fefc5a55/360_271_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0879b6eaae19914c451b1e7f178015dc","Adam Gemili slumps on the track after the race.

  ["Dire in Doha: world championships ‘catastrophe’ leaves athletics reeling","['Empty seats and ghostly silence have been the sad feature of this PR disaster for the sport, the IAAF, Lord Coe and Qatar']","['Moments after the greatest 10.83 seconds of Dina Asher-Smith’s life, the British sprinter grabbed a union flag from her mother, Julie, and began a lap of honour to celebrate her world championship 100m silver medal. But as she trotted round the 40,000-seat Khalifa stadium in Doha on Sunday night she was greeted by banks of empty seats and a ghostly silence.', 'Observers reckoned there were no more than 1,000 people still in attendance and many of them were journalists tapping away to deadline. Asher-Smith’s mother later tweeted she had seen more spectators at England Athletics’ age-group championships in Bedford.', 'Asher-Smith’s teammate Beth Dobbin was even more blunt. “I watched Dina’s victory lap and that was a bit heartbreaking because what she did was insane and there was no one there,” she said. “I feel like she was robbed of that moment.”', 'The organisers have since blamed the start of the working week and an event schedule designed for European TV audiences. But that cannot hide a simple fact. These world athletics championships have been a PR disaster for athletics, for the sport’s president, Sebastian Coe, and for Qatar, a country which has spent the past decade buying up rights to host major events, including the 2022 football World Cup.', 'Even Denise Lewis, the 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion who is not known for controversial views, has stuck the boot in, telling the BBC: “Our governing body has let our athletes down massively.” Meanwhile Eurosport, which holds Olympic TV rights across Europe, also mocked the lack of crowd for the women’s sprint final. “The Doha crowd roars with approval,” it tweeted with a gif of tumbleweed.', 'It is all a far cry from the promises made by Qatar in its first bid for these championships in 2011. “No empty seats,” the prospectus said, adding that “the atmosphere surrounding the world championships will be fantastic”.', 'That was a pledge that always looked spurious. But at least it was made several years ago. Coe, who was on the evaluation commission that inspected Doha’s bid for the 2019 championships and is reported to have later voted for it, said he hoped it would be “spectacular” just a few days ago.', 'Instead the stadium has often looked at least half empty, even though large parts of it have been covered with fabric and the capacity reduced to 21,000. And that is despite attendances being bolstered by organisers giving thousands of migrant workers from Africa and India free tickets.', 'On Monday they claimed that attendances had been “solid” for the first two days, at around 70%, but conceded “numbers were down on our expectations on day three with the start of the working week in Qatar”.', 'It added: “The challenge we face with a competition schedule that is geared to support global TV viewership is that some finals are not starting until the late evening. This impacts on the number of spectators remaining until the end of the session. We are confident that our renewed efforts will encourage the local community to come and witness the stunning performance of the world’s best athletes.', '“We know it is a balance and we are pleased global viewers can tune in to watch the live action from Doha.”', 'This, though, was a disaster foretold. After Doha was controversially awarded the championships – having offered £23.5m towards extra sponsorship and a promise to build 10 new tracks around the world minutes before the vote in 2014 when it defeated Eugene and Barcelona – the former IAAF board member Helmut Digel called it “incomprehensible”.', 'However José María Odriozola, a Spanish IAAF executive well-versed in the lingua franca of sports politics, cut to the heart of the matter. “All Doha have is money,” he said.', 'For many sports federations that is enough, whatever the athletes may think. Yet with every passing hour, more of them are voicing discontent. The French decathlete Kevin Mayer, the world record holder, has called the championships a “catastrophe”. Other athletes have claimed they are being treated as “guinea pigs” by a governing body that has forced marathon runners and race walkers to compete in 31C heat and high humidity, which has led to some being carried off the course in wheelchairs.', 'As Belarus’s Volha Mazuronak, who finished fifth in the women’s marathon in the early hours of Saturday morning, put it: “I thought I wouldn’t finish. It’s disrespect towards the athletes. A bunch of high-ranked officials gathered and decided that it would take the world championships here but they are sitting in the cool and they are probably sleeping right now.”', 'No one doubts that track and field has lost most of the momentum gained from the London 2017 world championships, which were watched by 750,000 people in the flesh and millions more on television. On Sunday evening Adam Gemili admitted it had been a “weird” event, adding: “It makes the British championships look quite good.” A colleague, the race walker Tom Bosworth, was even more cutting: “The only people carrying this sport are the athletes,” he said. “The IAAF truly should be ashamed.”', 'However, Coe continues to maintain that track and field must venture into new territories to help spread the word. Tell that to the 1,972 athletes from 208 countries here in Doha. For many this will be the pinnacle of their careers. How sad, then, that it has turned into a nadir for their sport.']","World Athletics Championships","Sport","2019-09-30",18.18,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df7f43f96f4bc0a6efde65c92170522a0f55fb4b/0_148_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=49920f6cc69450830201b89951066874","Dina Asher-Smith celebrated her lap of honour in front of empty seats at the world championships in Doha Photograph: Ian Stephen/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock","['Sean Ingle']","Sean Ingle is the Guardian's chief sports reporter.

Long live the king. Athletics has been scavenging around for someone to claim the world’s fastest man title since Usain Bolt’s retirement in 2017. In Christian Coleman, who blitzed to a stunning 100m gold medal here in Doha in 9.76sec, making him the sixth-fastest man in history, it has undoubtedly found him.', 'Some, like the legendary Michael Johnson, have suggested that the missed drugs tests that nearly derailed the 23-year-old American’s career last month might prevent him from becoming the face of his sport. But it is too late for that. For better or worse, that is what the softly spoken Coleman is now after claiming his first world title.', 'And long past midnight in the Khalifa International Stadium, he offered a spirited if sometimes odd defence of his reputation, repeatedly insisting he had not been careless despite missing a drugs test and two whereabouts failures in 12 months.', '“I guess you are insinuating something happened but I didn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “I haven’t been careless. Everyone in this room has not been perfect. I am just a young black man living my dream, people are trying to smear my reputation.', '“It is what it is, but I’ll just keep doing what I’ve been doing and focus on me,” he added. “Now I’m a world champion and that’s something that nobody can ever take away from me.”', 'Coleman was blunt on Johnson’s opinion too. “Michael Johnson doesn’t pay my bills and he doesn’t write my cheques,” he said. “I wouldn’t know who Michael Johnson was if he didn’t run fast times.”', 'The press conference was certainly more keenly contested than the final, which was done and dusted when Coleman established clear blue water over the field.', 'Justin Gatlin, who of course has a past of his own, ran faster than any 37-year-old in history to take silver in 9.89 while the Canadian Andre De Grasse was third in 9.90. But Britain’s Zharnel Hughes, who had been talked up as an outside medal prospect, was a disappointing sixth in 10.03.', '“My body wasn’t feeling up for it unfortunately,” admitted Hughes. “When I pushed out I was all over the place and I lost my form.', '“I was charged up for the race but as the gun banged I started feeling light headed for some reason and I tried my best to get composure and every time I tried to do something which was relaxing it just kept getting worse.”', 'This was the first major championships without Bolt since 2005, and the lack of crowds suggested the sport was missing its biggest star – and its greatest crutch. There has been much talk ever since on the need to jazz up the sport, and the IAAF certainly tried before the 100m final.', 'First the lights across the stadium went dark and the track lit up. Then disco music began to play and after the spotlight had focused on each athlete, the lights went back up and the sprinters were called to their blocks. The problem was that at this point the stadium was at least half empty, not that it bothered Coleman, who quickly blasted clear of the field.', 'Elsewhere the most exciting race of the night came in the women’s 10,000m as the Dutch athlete Sifan Hassan reeled in a pack of Kenyans and Ethiopians before sprinting clear of Letesenbet Gidey on the final lap to win her first world title in 30:17.63. What made the achievement even more incredible was that the 26-year-old Hassan ran the final 1500m of the race in under four minutes.', 'The biggest shock, meanwhile, came in the men’s long jump as the Jamaican Tajay Gayle recorded the 10th-longest leap in history – breaking his personal best by 37cm – to win gold in 8.69m, well clear of Jeff Henderson, who took silver, and Juan Miguel Echevarría, who won bronze.']","World Athletics Championships","Sport","2019-09-28",20.53,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b61be7382273928e30da54c548e95393b445b0/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7dae96c3a2afdee36b0756bfbd5266f0","Christian Coleman celebrates his 100m win in Doha.

However, even with a reduced capacity and reasonable ticket prices starting at 60 Qatari rial (£13), seats are still readily available.', 'Sources have told the Guardian that 50,000 tickets have been sold across the 10 days of action – and that migrant workers and children will be bused in to stop the stadium appearing more than half-empty on TV. That is a far cry from the optimism displayed when tickets went on sale, with organisers promising that there had been “registrations of interest from literally all corners of the world”.', 'An IAAF spokesperson accepted ticket sales had been “challenging” but said nobody could have foreseen the boycott of Qatar by other gulf states, making it impossible for some fans in the region to watch the championships.', 'When asked about the possibility of tickets being given away, the spokesperson added: “Surely it is a good thing that communities across Qatar will be getting tickets?

Embracing their second-placed status in the car hire market behind Hertz, the American company told the world: “When you’re only No 2, you try harder. Or else.” That line perfectly encapsulates Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s mindset as she prepares for the World Athletics Championships in Doha, which begin this Friday.', 'The 26-year-old has won World and European Indoor gold medals as well as Commonwealth gold over the past 17 months yet remains the second-best heptathlete in the world, behind the brilliant Belgian Nafi Thiam. But in recent months the Liverpudlian has driven herself harder than ever and she believes she is in the best shape of her life. “I don’t like to say that, obviously, because you have to deliver,” she says, chuckling to herself. “But I have had the best run-in ever in terms of preparation and now I just want to get out there and compete.', '“As long as I am making progress in each of my events, with my personal bests, I feel I can score those scores to put me in those positions to win a gold medal. And I don’t think I have ever had one where everything comes together at once and that is what I am working towards.”', 'Typically the world championships take place in August in Europe or east Asia. But for the first time they are being held in the Middle East, in temperatures loitering around 38C (100F), and in a country with a questionable human rights record. However, Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, has defended the decision to go to Qatar, saying it is important athletics heads to new territories in order to grow. “I’ve never known a situation where sport going into a fresh and new type of territory hasn’t actually flicked the dial both socially, culturally and politically in a very positive way,” Lord Coe said.', 'If Great Britain do hit the seven-to-nine medals target set by UK Sport for these championships, it will surely be because a trident of brilliant women athletes – Dina Asher-Smith in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, Laura Muir in the 1500m and Johnson-Thompson – have led the way and the relays have once again come good.', 'If Johnson-Thompson were to succeed, there would surely not be a more popular winner in the GB team, given her tear-soaked disappointments at the 2015 and 2017 worlds. In 2015 in Beijing she was favourite for gold going into the second day, only to foul three times in the long jump. Two years later in London she bombed out in the high jump, dashing any hopes of a medal. In 2016 there was more pain at the Rio Olympics when injury robbed her of a legitimate chance of gold. But there is a growing sense that those disappointments are now firmly behind her after a move to Montpellier in 2017, which has toughened her up mentally and physically.', '“At the last worlds I was only a summer into my move to France and, while I knew the training was going well, I wasn’t settled in the slightest,” she says. “I also didn’t have any belief in myself because I was still recovering from the 2015 and 2016 seasons, but it seems like a lifetime ago now. I feel I am growing each year as a person. It is coming into a world championships and Olympics next year and I am happy with the place I am in.”', 'Yet Johnson-Thompson knows she faces a formidable six-foot high barrier in her quest for gold in Doha in the form of Thiam, the 25-year-old who is arguably the best athlete across any sport. After all Thiam is not only good enough to have cleared 2.02m in the high jump (putting her second best in the world in 2019) but also to have a 6.86m personal best in the long jump (the ninth best of any woman this year). Her javelin best would put her in the world’s top 50 and she is no slouch in the 100m hurdles, shot put, 200m or 800m either.', '“She is very strong in a lot of events now,” Johnson-Thompson says. “We have seen her jump 2.02m and throw 59m with the javelin. She is definitely pushing me but I am not sure about the other way around.”', 'With two of Johnson-Thompson’s big rivals for the podium, Carolin Schäfer of Germany and Latvia’s Laura Ikauniece-Admidina, absent through injury it looks a straight shoot-out between Britain and Belgium for gold. Thiam is favourite but there is a question mark over an elbow that was injured earlier this summer and that gives Johnson‑Thompson legitimate hope. Whatever happens in Doha, she is determined to compete with a smile on her face. “It has been a long season but I am coming into shape at the right time,” she says. “I think I will enjoy every second of it.”']","Katarina Johnson-Thompson","Sport","2019-09-21",21.59,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2c22247ce4c2a65efa9eae392578eab6a8bb50/0_200_4806_2884/master/4806.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0669a084f12e95d07762a1ace001f14c","Katarina Johnson-Thompson: ‘I feel I can score those scores to put me in those positions to win a gold medal.’ Photograph: Robert Broger/Getty Images","['Sean Ingle']","Sean Ingle is the Guardian's chief sports reporter.

During the final laps, Verstappen had overtaken Hamilton but was obliged to hand the place back immediately, because he had gone beyond the track limits at turn four during the manoeuvre.', 'He and Red Bull immediately accepted the instruction from race control was correct, because the Dutchman had gained a “lasting advantage” in passing, but there was considerable controversy over the confusing application of the rules during the race at the same corner, where it appeared Hamilton had been gaining an advantage by taking the wide line.', 'Hamilton had been taking the wider, faster line on the understanding that it was acceptable because of the FIA instruction that track limits would not be monitored for lap times at that corner. Horner believes Hamilton’s line may have been worth as much as two-tenths of a second per lap. However, Hamilton was warned by the FIA over taking that wider line in mid-race.', 'Horner argued that there should be no room for interpretation in how the rules are applied. “With these track limit things, they’re always going to be contentious,” he said. “But we do need to just have a consistent situation. You can’t say: ‘It’s OK to use it in the race, but you can’t overtake out there.’ It should be black or white, it should not be shades of grey.”', 'Wolff agreed, citing the complexity of the instructions drivers and teams receive. “We need to be consistent in which messages are being given,” he said. “They need to be clear, they need to be sacred and not a Shakespeare novel that leaves interpretation.”', 'When Hamilton was informed he would face a warning and then potentially a penalty he stopped going wide but questioned why the rule had apparently changed mid-race.', 'The FIA race director, Michael Masi, insisted that the rules had not changed. He explained that the rules that stated turn four would not be monitored also warned drivers were not permitted to gain an advantage by going wide. However, that ‘advantage’ appears to mean in the context of overtaking or defending rather than lap time: certainly that seems to be how the majority of teams interpreted it.', 'More straightforward and clearly defined instructions for drivers were required, insisted Wolff. “At the beginning of the race it was said track limits in turn four wouldn’t be sanctioned,” he said. “Then in the race suddenly we heard that if you would continue to run wide it would be seen as an advantage and could cause a potential penalty.', '“The lesson of this is it needs to be simple, so everybody can understand it and they don’t need to carry the document in the car to read it and remind themselves what actually is allowed and what not.”']","Formula One","Sport","2021-03-29",17.46,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a486dec8fa49d455410f2272cb1bd8d762c268ee/0_172_3817_2290/master/3817.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=817d90d728f082c3a07cab0b40490c73","Max Verstappen (front) leads Lewis Hamilton at the Bahrain Grand Prix.

  ["F1 close to agreement on trio of sprint qualifying races in 2021 season","['Decision could be confirmed at Imola next weekend', 'Finishing order of sprint race will determine grid placings']","['Formula One is expected to soon confirm it will adopt three sprint qualifying races this season as a test for the format. The teams are understood to have come to an agreement on the potential financial implications of the move and an announcement is expected shortly, once the remaining technical details are ironed out. The decision could be confirmed as early as the next round at Imola next weekend.', 'The proposal of hosting a sprint race to replace qualifying on a Saturday has been under discussion for some time. F1’s owners, Liberty Media, were keen to try the new format as a way of providing greater spectacle for fans and with the finishing order deciding the grid for the grand prix on Sunday potentially mixing up the pecking order of the teams.', 'There had been considerable debate on the subject, with the teams willing to give it a try but intent on ensuring that its implementation was acceptable. The format adopted and intended to be trialled this season at Silverstone, Monza and Interlagos, would consist of a race of approximately one-third race distance, around 100km. The grid for the sprint will be decided by a qualifying session on Friday. A small number of points will be awarded but principally it will decide the grid for Sunday’s grand prix.', 'One of the major concerns for the teams was that it would have serious financial implications, especially in the first year that a budget cap has been imposed. The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, made clear his concerns at the season-opener in Bahrain.', '“What we can’t ignore is that to run and operate these cars is extremely expensive,” he said. “We need to find a solution how to combat that, in particular in a season where the budget cap is having a significant impact on how we operate.”', 'Those financial concerns have now been resolved. Agreement has been reached on meeting the extra costs and to cover potential damage incurred. Details on tyre usage and the adjustment to the DRS usage to increase overtaking remain under discussion. A formal agreement is expected within weeks, either at Imola or the following Portuguese Grand Prix.', 'F1 and the teams have been in agreement that the races, to be known as “spring qualifying”, do not detract from the grand prix on a Sunday. F1’s new chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, insisted that: “We do not want to take away the prestige of the grand prix itself. That will remain the climax of the weekend.” There will be no podium ceremony and it will not count as a “grand prix” win.', 'With the Australian and Chinese GPs postponed already this year, Imola was drafted in to host its second GP in two years next week for the rather ungainly-named Gran Premio Del Made In Italy E Dell’emilia Romagna.

  ["F1 rising star Yuki Tsunoda: ‘Every other driver is the enemy’","['AlphaTauri’s Japanese rookie has brought dash and verve to F1 and is unfazed by sharing a grid with a host of world champions']","['There is a joyful exuberance to Yuki Tsunoda that is almost magnetic. The Japanese driver has brought dash and verve to Formula One and has been unafraid to pepper it with expletives. Refreshingly the 20-year-old, one of F1’s most exciting prospects, is unrepentant. ', 'His rise has been positively meteoric but tangling at the sharper end of a grid populated by four world champions and some exceptional talent besides holds no fears for Tsunoda. “When I am racing I do not think about them,” he says without hesitation at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari before this weekend’s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola. “Every driver is the same for me, they are the enemy. I don’t think about whether they are world champions or that it is an honour to race them, not when I am driving.”', 'After only one race Tsunoda has drawn plaudits from across the paddock. He scored points on his debut for AlphaTauri at the season opener in Bahrain. His driving caught the attention as did his occasional swearing over team radio; F1 apparently shocked at a young man venting publicly with such unabashed brio.', 'Tsunoda, who grew up in Sagamihara City, chuckles gently – surprised at the interest his colourful grasp of English has attracted – but sees no reason to neuter his character behind the wheel.', '“When I am gaming with my friends I swear a lot in my house in Japan,” he says. “I go more crazy than in racing – like throwing the controller – I made two holes already in my apartment. I broke a couple of things which is double stress for me. In racing I always have passion, I am more serious about the racing so it’s easy to swear but at the same time I am really focused.”', 'His former team boss in F2, Trevor Carlin from the Carlin team, even offered his belated apologies to the AlphaTauri principal Franz Tost, albeit tinged with pride. “Yuki has spent a year with a bunch of British mechanics learning all the British swear words,” he says. “Which I think Franz was a bit shocked about with Yuki effing and blinding on the radio. But he genuinely enjoys racing, he is fiercely loyal, he will embed himself in the team really well and is like a sponge for knowledge.”', 'F1 needs characters and Tsunoda is a breath of fresh air, with an infectious enthusiasm backed by talent, ambition and a mature work ethic. In Bahrain, with AlphaTauri enjoying a very competitive car, he started from 13th, made a poor opening lap and dropped to 17th before coming back strongly to claim ninth. His performance was lauded, not least in becoming the first Japanese driver to score points since Kamui Kobayashi in 2012.', 'Tsunoda began karting when he was four and encouraged by his father continued doing it for fun until he was 10 when he began to take driving seriously. He was taken on by Honda in 2016 and competed in two full seasons of Japanese F4 in 2017 and 2018 when Red Bull made him part of their junior driver programme. He then spent one season in F3, graduating to F2 in 2020 before promotion to AlphaTauri this year.', 'His rise has been remarkable but reflective of his talent. He is fiercely competitive. At Bahrain his comeback included a dive past Fernando Alonso for a place and mugging Lance Stroll on the last lap to clinch ninth. It was celebrated but in character for Tsunoda. In the final race of last year’s F2 season at Bahrain he similarly passed Dan Ticktum on the final corner of the final lap to take second place. Tsunoda is relentless. “He never gives up, he fights to the very, very end,” Carlin notes.', 'Tsunoda has come this far under no little pressure. Red Bull’s director of motorsport, Helmut Marko, has set hard targets for him to reach in order to be retained. Unsurprisingly he has shown an extraordinary ability to learn and improve with alacrity.', 'His F3 year was his first living outside Japan and even with an uncompetitive team, he managed to win a race. In F2, Marko had mandated a top-three finish which Carlin believed was a tall order for any rookie until he saw how good the Japanese driver was. Indeed he is convinced that Tsunoda could have won the title, he was the top rookie and the absence of errors was notable. If it had been decided on the feature length races alone – those most similar to F1 – he would have done so and he did secure third.', 'At his F1 debut, however, he made his mark on a much grander palette. F1’s director of motorsport, Ross Brawn, described him as the “best rookie F1 has had for years, fairly stunning in whatever series he has competed in”. Even the notoriously hard to impress Marko was moved to offer high praise. “We are convinced Tsunoda will be the first Japanese driver to win an F1 grand prix,” he said. “His mentality is also great, he has incredible self-confidence. I am convinced we will see him on the podium soon.”', 'It seems Tsunoda has it all. He is unafraid to throw his car into a pass but has the maturity required to ensure his skills progress. “We only had to explain something to him once and he would go and do it – the perfect pupil,” says Carlin. “Race craft is one of his greatest strengths. It is very rare to find a driver who can apply what they are told immediately, some think they know better, some just can’t do it, some don’t understand but Yuki just went and applied it. He is the full package, he really is. I am convinced he will be on the podium this year. He is just born to be a racing driver, he finds it very easy to deliver. The sky is the limit for him.”', 'Tsunoda will be confident this weekend at Imola, a track where he has tested extensively. This is a home race for AlphaTauri whose Faenza base is only 12 miles away and there is a sense that despite coming so far, so fast, this is only the beginning of something special. Certainly Tsunoda’s enthusiasm remains unbridled and long may it remain so.', '“I always come to the track to go faster, of course that puts more pressure on me but that pressure works well to focus,” he says. “People think I was happy to score my first points, I was happy but I was thinking more about what I could improve. I knew I could have got a better result in Bahrain, the car was there and top five was easily possible. I have some regrets and a lot of things to learn, even immediately after the race I was thinking: ‘Where can I improve?’”', 'Valtteri Bottas led his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton in first practice at Imola, with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in third. The top three were closely matched, separated by only five-hundredths of a second. In the afternoon Verstappen suffered a setback, losing almost the entire session when he came to a halt with a driveshaft problem. Bottas was on top once more, one-hundredth ahead of Hamilton, with Tsunoda an impressive seventh.']","Formula One","Sport","2021-04-16",15.58,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c14b651dbd805d53ebafdc53423ad2ca6e64d9/0_8_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=1020&quality=85&fit=max&s=f39aa736eb744000ec71b23a70bb1508","Yuki Tsunoda of AlphaTauri prepares for practice at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola.

  ["Callum Smith prepares for fight of his life against Saul 'Canelo' Álvarez","['Unbeaten Liverpudlian towers over the Mexican, who he faces in Texas on Sunday, but the odds remain against him']","['Saul “Canelo” Álvarez is more than a fighter, he’s an industry. And, for all the restrictions of the pandemic and boxing politics, business is still good – as Callum Smith has recently discovered.', 'Late on Saturday in San Antonio, Texas (early Sunday morning GMT), they will argue over the unbeaten Liverpudlian’s WBA “super” super-middleweight title as the incomparable Mexican reaches for a world championship to go with his several belts at light-middle, middleweight and light-heavyweight gathered over nearly a decade in a 56-fight career that began as a teenager 15 years ago.', 'For all the credentials of other excellent contemporaries such as Terence Crawford, Nayoya Inoue, Errol Spence Jr and Oleksandr Usyk, the red-headed 30-year-old phenomenon from Guadalajara bears favourable comparison with Julio César Chávez, who terrorised the best in his business over three weights in the last two decades of the 20th century.', 'Smith, also 30, brings his own spotless CV to Texas at short notice, and, although he is acknowledged as pre-eminent at 12 stone, he is talking like a fighter privileged to be sharing a little piece of hell with a boxing nightmare. Neither has fought for over a year; they are about to make up for lost time and revenue.', 'In this millennium, only Floyd Mayweather Jr (to whom he lost in 2013) has had greater commercial clout than Álvarez, who chose Smith – not the other way around – giving the champion a mere month to prepare and travel to his turf. A purse of $40m when the fight was first mooted before lockdowns gripped the world has probably shrunk to a quarter of that, with Álvarez likely to pocket the bigger slice.', 'In the Alamodome, a stadium just over a mile from the battle where Davy Crockett simultaneously perished at the hands of Mexico’s General Santa Anna and was confirmed as an American wild west hero, Smith knows he is in for the fight of his life. He has to put aside the brief preparation he has been allowed, and said: “There’s plenty of different ways to get in shape. It hasn’t been ideal, but you make do with what you’ve got, and I’m in very good shape.”', 'There won’t be more than a scattering of citizens inside a biosecure stadium that holds up to 64,000 fans, but the tension and sense of occasion will be considerable, nonetheless.', 'In normal circumstances, Smith would be preparing for Christmas back in Liverpool inside an altogether more welcoming bubble of his three boxing brothers and their close family. He might have contemplated a mid-winter round of golf at Wallasey, where he has performed enthusiastically. Álvarez is a keen golfer, too, but their skills are now trained on a more dangerous pursuit.', 'When they faced off for the first time at the venue this week, Smith towered over Álvarez by fully half a foot at 6ft 3in, and he invests his rangy frame with power that has proved too much for 19 of his 27 opponents, including George Groves to secure his title two years ago.', 'None of his experiences will match this one, though. It was not of his making, but he is happy with that. As Álvarez said: “We chose Callum Smith because he’s ranked No 1 in the 168lb division. And, in the end, that’s what I want. I have a strong mindset. I know how to handle all of this.” He certainly does.', 'In 2018, DAZN signed Álvarez to a 12-fight contract worth $365m – nearly $180m more than it cost to build the venue in which they are fighting. This year, though, it turned ugly. DAZN, Eddie Hearn’s streaming partner, wanted their star to take a pay cut because of the coronavirus, he argued with his long-time promoters at Golden Boy and they went their separate ways. However, after some hard talking, DAZN got back in the Álvarez business, alongside Matchroom, Hearn and Smith.', 'As far as any respected historian can determine, Álvarez is the first boxer to fight brothers in world title fights at different weights, having cut up and stopped Callum’s brother, Liam, in nine rounds at light-middle in 2016. The Mexican earlier repulsed worthy British challenges by Matthew Hatton, Ryan Rhodes and Amir Khan.', 'There can be no doubting Smith’s determination or ability to stop the rot, although he is a 4-1 underdog. For maybe half an hour in San Antonio, he gets his own Battle of the Alamo, and a rearguard Liverpool victory would be the biggest upset of recent times; if Smith finishes upright, he will have given Álvarez a serious fright, and that alone would be a memorable achievement.']","Boxing","Sport","2020-12-18",15.08,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/556f45a120a227572bbe2c57d47d68a85ee95255/77_277_3347_2009/master/3347.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=b9953b32f4245ea5c799aea7776f4979","The pandemic has meant Callum Smith has had a reduced preparation period for Sunday’s fight.

If Smith were to spring the upset of the year, an all-British fight with Saunders would be a distinct possibility next summer, says Eddie Hearn, but Álvarez is the target for everyone at or around super-middleweight.', 'After outpointing the 38-year-old Murray, 120-109 twice and 118-110 in the third defence of his title, Saunders said: “I’ve just turned 31. I’m in my prime. I’ve been out a year and probably needed the rounds. It’s very important for me to stay in the gym now, because I’m not getting any younger.”', 'Hearn, his promoter, said: “The deal was done with Canelo and it was a massive blow when it was called off. We can’t waste the opportunity to find out how good Billy is, but he’s not yet mixing with the elite of the elite: [Gennady] Golovkin, Canelo, Smith.”', 'Murray hinted he would retire, revealing he had hurt his back two weeks before the fight, an injury which flared in the eighth round, but said: “I lost to the better man.” He will surely join the likes of Herol Graham and Kevin Mitchell as among the best British fighters never to win a world title, but he came desperately close, especially against the outstanding Sergio Martínez in Argentina in 2013.', 'Murray also took Golovkin 11 rounds, drew with Felix Sturm and lost a split decision to Arthur Abraham, all of them outstanding fighters. Saunders, though, had his measure in nearly every round.', '“He’s a cunning old fox,” Saunders said. “He got through it and fair play to him. I hope he has a good Christmas.”', 'Hearn was right to point out that Saunders was hard on himself after an impressive display against one of British boxing’s best. There were no knockdowns, although Saunders reckoned he deserved one when Murray went over in the fourth; it was ruled a slip.', 'If a crowd had been allowed, they would have given both fighters a standing ovation at the end but, as Saunders pointed out, “it was like fighting in a cemetery”.']","Boxing","Sport","2020-12-04",23.45,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93413db50e29c6292eb8f4aeee27626ef50c4b9c/0_349_6738_4044/master/6738.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=27717246c719ae8fc033694f797ed8bc","Billy Joe Saunders forces Martin Murray on the defensive during their WBO super-middleweight title fight at Wembley Arena.

I love and miss it'","['The 47-year-old promoter on his preparations for a comeback after 12 years out of the ring and why his young lightweight hope Ryan García will be an even bigger star than himself']","['It has always been tough to tell if Oscar De La Hoya is smiling because he feels blessed to be alive or because he has something to sell. With teeth as white as his it is as easy to fix a grin as not and in pandemic-gripped boxing, there has not been much to smile about.', 'In a Zoom conversation from his home in California, the Golden Boy smiles pretty much from start to finish. He has two items to sell, as it happens: his unbeaten young lightweight, Ryan García, who fights Luke Campbell for the interim WBC lightweight title in Dallas on Saturday, and himself.', 'After declaring García could be a bigger star than he was, De La Hoya confirms he wants to box again, perhaps against Gennady Golovkin. Before GGG’s successful extension of his own career this month, he all but threatened to kill De La Hoya if they shared a ring. They have history. This, surely, was not a good career move for someone who turns 48 in February and has not fought in 12 years.', 'He generated $700m as a fighter and it is said he has hung on to more than $200m of it. So money should not be an issue. “It is a serious proposition. The main reason is because I love it and I miss it,” he says, beaming like a man given the choice of reliving his past or listening to Barry Manilow for the rest of his life.', 'A Golovkin fight is wildly optimistic. Even at 38, he is formidable enough coming off an excellent win over the younger, unbeaten Kamil Szeremeta to stay in the mix for a third fight with boxing’s pound-for-pound best, Saul ‘Canelo’ Álvarez – whom De La Hoya promoted until they split this year.', '“Golovkin is a very strong fighter, but I’ve always said if he fights Canelo one more time, he’s very, very vulnerable, because Canelo looked amazing [beating Callum Smith in 12 one-sided rounds]. He looked fast, he looked strong. Doesn’t throw enough punches, like [Julio] César Chávez, but he gets the job done. But, yes, he is a consideration, Golovkin.”', 'Once a fighter, always a fighter? “Exactly!”', 'Except that is only true in the imagination. What De La Hoya is contemplating is public self-destruction to scratch an itch – which is why he came out of retirement to fight Manny Pacquiao in 2008 and got his butt kicked for the seven rounds it lasted.', '“For the last maybe six, seven months I’ve been feeling great,” he says. “My body fat is very low. I’m maybe 10 pounds [from] where I want to be. Right now I’m 170. I just want to make sure that when I start sparring I don’t get injured.”', 'De La Hoya is inspired by Mike Tyson’s exhibition “draw” against Roy Jones Jr a month ago, 15 years after Kevin McBride finished his real career. “What Mike Tyson did was very inspirational,” he says. “He looked great. He looked like the old Mike Tyson, against a fighter who at one point was the best on the planet.”', 'The screaming caveat is “at one point was”. De La Hoya concedes Tyson’s reflexes “were a little off” but adds: “If you give your body, your mind, your soul enough time to prepare for a fight you can do it – if you’re injury-free.”', 'Oscar’s world is full of ifs. But he draws strength from another legend who briefly did come back, albeit in better circumstances. Before Sugar Ray Leonard beat Marvin Hagler in 1987, he spent 12 months having real fights behind closed doors, with 10oz gloves and no headgear to simulate the feel of combat again.', '“I would do [that]. I would stage some real fights in the gym, no headgear, smaller gloves – just to make sure everything is OK. It would be against a real fighter, an active fighter. I fought the very best in the prime of my career, so I wouldn’t do any different.”', 'In a 16-year career that persuaded The Ring magazine to rate him the 14th of all time, De La Hoya outclassed the best of his era: César Chávez (twice), Pernell Whitaker, Héctor Camacho, Ike Quartey, Rafael Ruelas and Genaro Hernández among many others. Only the best beat him: Felix Trinidad, Shane Mosley (twice), Bernard Hopkins, Floyd Mayweather Jr and Pacquiao. In victory and defeat, age played a part. It always does.', 'Back in the real world, he sees the striking similarities between himself and García, a Californian Mexican with flashing fists, good looks and an astonishing fanbase. “He’s a very confident young kid with a lot of abilities. I strongly feel Ryan García is probably the hardest worker in boxing today. He loves what he does. He knows what he wants – and I believe he’s gonna be successful at it.”', 'There is growing sentiment García, whose fight with Campbell is live on streaming channel DAZN, could be everything De La Hoya says he will be. But there are traps, as De La Hoya discovered, distracted at the height of his celebrity. “It’s extremely difficult when the whole world is telling you you’re going to be great. I believe he’s destined to become the most popular fighter on the planet. He only has, like, 7.5m [Instagram] followers at the tender age of 22, so I imagine when he’s like Canelo, at 30 years of age, [he will] have 30, 40 million followers, easily.', '“Everybody is talking about how special he’s gonna be and how special he is. I’m thinking as a fighter now, if I were in his position, I would feel a little nervous, maybe a little: ‘Wow, am I going to live up to this expectation? It makes me work harder, it makes me focus more on what I want to accomplish over the years.’ That pressure is going to lead him to become great. He’s a big 135-pounder. I believe he can get up to 154 … maybe 160?”', 'De La Hoya, as promoter, is bound to acknowledge Campbell will be a worthy challenger, given the 33-year-old Yorkshireman has mixed at a much higher level as a professional over a far longer time and comes to the contest bursting with confidence.', '“Luke Campbell is a very, very dangerous fighter for anyone. He has an Olympic gold medal, he’s very dedicated, devoted to his craft. Luke Campbell is the same height as Ryan García. He’s a southpaw, he’s gonna present some problems. It’s not gonna be easy. Ryan has to be on his A-game.”', 'De La Hoya’s smile illuminates our Zoom farewell and I’m left wondering if it is still there after he clicks the “leave” button, a blunt metaphor for his boxing life.

But it is typical of the heavyweight that when he woke up and discovered his brother Dean had intervened to stop the dramatic incident he wished he had got involved.', '“I didn’t know what Dean had done,” he said. “I was asleep. I’d trained and jumped on the plane so I was a bit tired. When I woke up I heard all about it. I was disappointed he didn’t hit the guy, I would have just knocked him out, to be honest, because that’s no joking matter. My brother gave him a chance but I would have knocked him out clean. I probably would have hit him on the floor as well.”', 'For someone who relishes a tear-up Whyte has barely laced up his gloves in anger since beating Óscar Rivas in July, due to an adverse finding in a UK Anti-Doping sample. The case is still unresolved, although he has been cleared to fight. He laughs when it is suggested his brother is getting more fights than him at the moment – but the frustration is evident too.', '“It’s been stressful and a few times I’ve thought about walking away from boxing and jacking it in,” admitted Whyte. “I’m not someone to talk about my emotions, but I have been stressed and down and depressed. But my team kept pushing me, urging me to go to the gym and taking the mickey out of me, saying my belly was getting bigger.', '“I’m a very strong person mentally and physically, but without my team I would have walked away from boxing without a doubt.”', 'But at least one cloud is lifting. On Saturday he returns to the ring to face Mariusz Wach on the undercard of the Andy Ruiz Jnr v Anthony Joshua rematch.', '“Wach is gonna get whacked,” said Whyte. “He’s very experienced and he knows how to survive. He’s got a very good jab. So it’s up to me to go in there and bring maximum pain, as I do. I will be trying to knock him out.', '“The last few months have been tough. But you know me, it doesn’t take much to get me in a fight. And I will come to the ring with maximum violent intentions.”', 'Whyte’s only defeat in 27 fights has come at the hands of Joshua and, as he points out, he has also spent more than 600 days as the No 1 contender with the WBC. “Never in the history of heavyweight boxing has someone been mandatory contender for so long,” Whyte laments. “Except maybe Jack Johnson and Sonny Liston.”', 'He hopes he will cross paths again with Joshua, who he beat in the amateurs, for a decider. “We both respect each other but it’s a weird thing,” he said. “It’s like we hate each other, but respect each other. It’s just a job.”', 'He also expects Joshua to regain his WBA, IBF and WBO titles against Ruiz. “Hopefully his head is in the right space and he doesn’t listen to all this negativity because as a country we like bringing each other down too much,” he said. “Someone loses, ‘ah he was rubbish, he was no good’. You weren’t saying that a few months ago when he was heavyweight champion of the world. None of his critics are going to be hall of fame. He will.”', 'As for Whyte himself, he is quietly hopeful of getting his career back on track. “Boxing is a very dark, muddy, murky waters,” he says. “One day you’re floating and the next day you’re sinking. I’ve learnt a lot of lessons from boxing. It’s made me stronger as a person and given me a better life.”', 'He smiles again. “Life is hard, man. But two things I know are to be brave and to fight.

  ["Andy Ruiz Jr denies becoming complacent since Anthony Joshua fight","[' Ruiz promises to be slicker and faster in Saturday’s rematch']","['Andy Ruiz Jr has denied becoming complacent since shocking the world to become the heavyweight champion – and promised he will be slicker and faster for Saturday night’s rematch with Anthony Joshua.', 'Ruiz celebrated winning the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight belts by buying five cars – including two types of Mercedes G-Class, a Rolls Royce and a Lamborghini as well as a truck for his parents – but says his competitive fire rages brighter than ever. While the Mexican-American expects Joshua to come in much lighter in their second fight in a bid to outmanoeuvre him, he predicts another stoppage.', '“We’ve been training on being small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch,” Ruiz said. “I know he is going to try to box me around, that’s why he has lost some weight. He’ll try to keep me away with the jab but that’s exactly what we’ve been practising for.', '“I think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up. He’s not good enough to avoid me for the full 12 rounds on the back foot. We’ve been working on this for around three months now and I know, whatever he brings, we will be ready for it.”', 'Ruiz admitted that part of his tactics have involved enraging Joshua by calling him a quitter for spitting out his gumshield in their first fight. “I am pretty sure he was mad at me,” he said, “but that is what I felt in my heart, he spat his mouthpiece out and quit.', '“I respect the man outside the ring. I would always hug him and shake his hand, so it’s all about respect. But I want him to be mad and swinging in the ring, I want him to have that attitude because I will be calm and know exactly what we need to do.”', 'Ruiz, who expects to weigh just over 19st again as he did for the first fight with Joshua, also revealed he had been talking to the WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, about a unification fight. “Me and Wilder actually talk on the phone, we are good friends,” he said. “We know what is in the plan.”']","Boxing","Sport","2019-12-05",22.3,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7ac5708d11760ef358a3961ad275efa4f10709/0_140_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=72e57ad6aaf95cb4c307aa1a2f026261","Andy Ruiz Jr said of Anthony Joshua: ‘He’s not good enough to avoid me for the full 12 rounds on the back foot.’ Photograph: Nick Potts/PA","['Sean Ingle']","Sean Ingle is the Guardian's chief sports reporter.

  ["Andy Ruiz Jr's plan to make Anthony Joshua's height work against him","['The Mexican-American giant-killer, who cut his teeth fighting bigger opponents, says the Briton’s style is perfect for him']","['The superficial differences in the physiques of Andy Ruiz Jr and Anthony Joshua were laid bare even more dramatically than six months ago at Friday’s weigh-in on a sun-splashed afternoon outside the Al Faisaliyah Centre in downtown Riyadh.', 'The doughy Ruiz came in at 20st 3lb (283lb) for Saturday’s rematch, more than a stone above the svelte-for-him 268lb of their encounter in June, while the slimmed-down yet still-sculpted Joshua weighed 16st 3lb (237lb), down 10 pounds from the worst night of his boxing life.', 'Yet the physical disadvantages Ruiz will face at the Diriyah Arena on the north-west outskirts of the Saudi capital – four inches in height, eight inches in reach with a body mass index breaking the scale – are hardly different than those he overcame the first time when he overwhelmed Joshua for the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles at Madison Square Garden.', 'That was no fluke. No “punch from the gods” that can be explained away. After showing otherworldly punch resistance after coming back from a heavy knockdown in the third round, Ruiz’s deceptively quick hand speed and in-fighting made the upright champion look basic – and offered a compelling case for why the Mexican-American nicknamed the Destroyer appears to be a stylistic nightmare for a tall-and-straight puncher such as Joshua.', '“I think his style was just perfect for me and I think [Saturday] will be the same,” Ruiz said this week. “I think he will box around nicely for four or five rounds until I take the pressure to him, start hitting his body and mixing it up.', '“That is exactly what we have been training on. Being small, being more slick, applying pressure, throwing combinations and being first to the punch. I know he is going to try to box me around, that is why he lost some weight, he will try to keep me away with the jab. But that’s what we have been practising for.”', 'The initial efforts to make sense of Ruiz’s shock upset – a stunner that ranks alongside Buster Douglas v Mike Tyson and James Braddock v Max Baer among the most seismic in the division’s lengthy annals – pointed toward the superior amateur pedigree of the 30-year-old from south-eastern California, who banked nearly three times as many fights and a decade more experience in the unpaid ranks as the late-starting Joshua.', 'Yet a closer inspection of these formative years offers further insight into Ruiz’s giant-killing ways: he has been cutting his teeth on bigger guys nearly his entire life.', 'Ruiz was 12st 8lb (180lb) at nine years old, which led his father to put him in with older kids who could handle the youngster’s unique blend of size and speed. He was made to spar with professionals often twice his age on those endless trips across the US-Mexico border to train at gyms in Mexicali, where he became accustomed to problem-solving against opponents far bigger than him.', 'Andy Ruiz Sr recalls the way he got the attention of Freddie Roach when he first made the 200-mile journey from Imperial to Los Angeles to train for the Mexican Olympic trials at the Wild Card boxing club, getting the best of a series of the famed trainer’s professional heavyweights when he was still a teenager.', '“He beat the shit out of Javier Mota, a much taller Mexican, who had 24 fights and one loss at the time,” the elder Ruiz said. “He knocked that guy down when he was 16 years old.”', 'Jorge Muñoz, who runs the Sparta boxing gym in El Centro where Ruiz came of age and still occasionally trains, believes the seeds planted during those Wild Card sessions more than a decade ago came into full bloom when their hometown hero got the chance of a lifetime against Joshua. “You could see all the stuff they taught him to fight the big guys, all those tricks about putting the forehand on their neck, hitting them in the forehead.” Muñoz said. “Those little details work for him because he’s always been in with guys who are taller. He knows how to work inside and over [in Europe] they don’t know how to work inside.”', 'Muñoz added: “It’s the Mexican style: body shots and uppercuts. Andy has a crazy jab to the stomach and Joshua is not used to getting hit right there. If you watch all his fights, nobody ever hits him there, because he’s fought all those guys from over there who are just one-two, one-two [to the head] and nothing with the body.”', 'Joshua will attempt to become only the fourth deposed heavyweight champion to win an immediate rematch after Floyd Patterson (against Ingemar Johansson in 1960), Muhammad Ali (against Leon Spinks in 1978) and Lennox Lewis (against Hasim Rahman in 2001).', 'A greater number have failed in the task, among them Jersey Joe Walcott (both to Rocky Marciano), Patterson (both to Sonny Liston), Larry Holmes (both to Michael Spinks) and Mike Tyson (both to Evander Holyfield).', 'Muñoz believes six months is too quick a turnaround for Joshua to absorb the necessary lessons.', '“I think it’s too short notice,” he said. “Joshua already knows how he could beat him, by jabbing and moving around, but Andy already knows what he needs to do. When Joshua won the gold medal, he fought from the outside. But that’s all amateur. Eventually a pro gets in there and it’s about how you work on the inside.”', 'Ruiz’s father, who says he won $50,000 betting on his son to defeat Joshua when they first met, said he is even more confident for Saturday’s showdown – even if it looks as if he has enjoyed a few too many cheat days at hometown favourites Johnny’s Burritos and Donut Avenue. “We’re going to win the fight.”']","Boxing","Sport","2019-12-07",10,"Sat","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37887869748cb464fb3d42a664230c20c1fd8230/0_122_3265_1960/master/3265.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=79b3019c56ad015c500856544e033497","Andy Ruiz Jr (right) lands a punch on Anthony Joshua at Madison Square Garden in June.

  ["England head for Rome and day of destiny with new gladiators","['Eddie Jones has picked four debutants for the visit to Italy, where England hope to win a first Six Nations title since 2017 ']","['It is not often that a team hoping to close out a Six Nations title on the final weekend includes four uncapped players among its glory hunters. The England side heading to Rome may now have an appropriately ancient and modern feel but there is also less certainty in some key areas than there might be.', 'While Ben Youngs, who will win his 100th England cap, seems to have been around almost as long as the Colosseum, the same cannot be said of Jonny Hill, Tom Dunn, Ollie Thorley and Ollie Lawrence, the four new red rose gladiators strapping on their breastplates on Saturday. With two specialist outside centres together in midfield, no specialist reserve 10 and the lack of a warmup game, very little can be entirely guaranteed.', 'Eddie Jones, though, used an interesting word as he expanded on his selection for England’s first game since March. “The players have approached this camp with a zest for the game I have never seen before,” suggested the head coach, who has been around a few blocks in his long career. The obvious hope is that enthusiasm and pent-up energy will make up for a conspicuous lack, in some cases, of recent club form.', 'The desire to achieve a suitable result for Youngs and hooker Jamie George, who will earn his 50th England cap, will certainly be strong. Both are hugely popular squad members who remain just as approachable and grounded as they were at the outset of their careers, a genuine credit to their respective clubs – Leicester and Saracens – and their families.', 'But even as head coach Eddie Jones was singing Youngs’s praises – “At his best he’s close to the best half-back in the world … he is an important, infectious character in our squad” – he was also clearly mindful England need to remain switched on after swapping their Teddington “bubble” for the Italian capital where demonstrations against the latest Covid-19 restrictions, including a 6pm curfew for bars and restaurants, have intensified this week.The eerie backdrop will be a far cry from the convivial, laidback atmosphere of a traditional Rome Six Nations weekend, with thousands of travelling English supporters enjoying la dolce vita. The final weekend maths also dictate that England will have to click properly into gear for a large chunk of the game to claim a first championship title since 2017. The last three English visits to Rome have yielded winning margins of 31, 31 and 41 points respectively and something similar may be required again if Ireland or France are to be edged out on points difference.Central to any backline fluency, in particular, will be the way Owen Farrell, Henry Slade and Jonathan Joseph dovetail at 10-12-13, with Slade invited to fill the gaping hole left by the injured Manu Tuilagi while Farrell shifts to 10 for the unavailable George Ford. All now have plenty of experience but Slade has been otherwise engaged winning trophies with Exeter until last weekend and Farrell has not played since being sent off against Wasps almost eight weeks ago.', 'George Furbank at full-back also still has a bit to prove after a tricky start to his international career but Jones remains an admirer and even reckons the Northampton player has the attributes to slot in as a 10 if required. If Farrell were to go down in a heap in the opening minutes, however, it is more likely Jones would look to Slade, who has played a fair amount at fly-half in the past if not much lately. Should the strong-running Lawrence and Thorley also make it on to the field in the second half, it will turn into a very unfamiliar-looking English backline indeed.', 'Either way, it is up front where England’s coaches will be aiming to exert serious pressure and, in the process, give an armchair chariot ride to their centurion Youngs. Rome may already have seven hills but this weekend it will have an eighth, standing 6ft 7in tall and fresh from a European and Premiership double with Exeter.', 'Jonny Hill did make it on to England’s bench once before, as a non-playing replacement in Cape Town in 2018, but he reckons he is better prepared now: “I’m a totally different player and character to when England picked me. I’m two years older and have another 50-odd Premiership games in me. I still feel I haven’t reached my ceiling yet.”', 'The 26-year-old takes his place in a pack which is, otherwise, exactly the same as the one which kicked off the World Cup final in Yokohama 12 months ago. Billy Vunipola has not played for England since and will be mighty keen to reassert himself while Tom Curry and Sam Underhill now have the fast-rising Jack Willis on their heels.', 'Kyle Sinckler and Mako Vunipola, likewise, occupy positions in which there is now fierce competition. Youngs will hog the headlines as he prepares to become just the second English player after Jason Leonard to reach three figures but as England await the final title push it is their forwards who will shape their destiny.']","Six Nations 2020","Sport","2020-10-29",17.23,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c6fc0eb408267a19e5e8b39e8d29af19240c8c5/0_96_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=e28d25e894b55b45c907c3268f4d68d9","Sam Simmonds scores a try during England’s last visit to Rome in 2018.

Three teams were also challenging for the title on the final day five years ago and Ireland pipped England after France scored five tries and 35 points at Twickenham in a crazy finale.', '“Attack and defence will be equally important,” said Mitchell. “The performance has to win the game and it is dangerous to get too focused on the scoreboard. We have to set the tone from the start and put ourselves in a position after 40 minutes. Then we can look to put the foot on the throat.”', 'England will be without the scrum-half Willi Heinz who sustained a soft tissue injury in training. Northampton’s uncapped Alex Mitchell was called into the squad, but it leaves Ben Youngs in line to start and become England’s second cap centurion, with Dan Robson on the bench.', 'The back row is likely to take up much of the selection meeting with Jack Willis, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Billy Vunipola, Ben Earl, Lewis Ludlam and Ted Hill vying for the three starting positions.', '“We have depth and competition there,” Mitchell said. “Test rugby is different to the club game and it is about adapting to it, the ability to win collisions with and without the ball, its speed, repeated actions and less space. It is about adapting: some players have it in their skill set while others take a bit longer.”', 'Ireland will be the champions if they win with a bonus point at Stade de France, a ground where they have been restricted to kicks on their last two visits. They have made one change from the side who defeated Italy last weekend with Robbie Henshaw replacing the injured Garry Ringrose in the midfield.', 'The European Champions Cup winners Exeter have been drawn with Toulouse, the side they defeated in last month’s semi-final, and Glasgow, for the fourth time in the group stage, in next season’s tournament which starts in December, a week after the international programme concludes.

Scotland’s head coach, Gregor Townsend, was under pressure for the first time since taking over in 2017 and had dropped one of his talismen, the outside-half Finn Russell, for disciplinary reasons. But that was long ago and the systematic way they dismantled Wales’s threats on Saturday suggested a foundation has been laid.', 'Scotland profited from the lack of a crowd and the energy they drew from simple successes, such as winning a penalty at a scrum or breakdown and making a telling tackle, contrasted with the home side’s introspection. The 16-7 penalty count against Wales may not have been repeated had they been playing in front of their vocal supporters at the Principality Stadium, but in the past year they have been travelling in the opposite direction to Scotland. Their head coach, Wayne Pivac, now has some major decisions to make over players who served his predecessor, Warren Gatland, for all or most of the past decade.', '“There was a lot of thought and reflection from me and others after the World Cup,” said Townsend. “I felt we would be able to become more consistent given the players we have and the lessons we had learned. One of the things we had to change was being in positions to win matches as we went into the final 20 minutes.', '“I have big belief in this team and our long-term aim is to have a 30-35 strong squad where the quality on the bench is as good as that in the starting line-up. We have long had the ability to score 14 points in two minutes, but the control in the set-pieces has probably surpassed what I thought we could achieve this season.”', 'Scotland are grouped with France, Italy and Fiji in the Autumn Nations Cup and will have home advantage against Les Bleus, the fixture that should decide who finishes first. A problem for Townsend is that he faces being without Russell, who came off in the first-half of the 14-10 victory over Wales with a groin injury, and his replacement, Adam Hastings, who popped a shoulder. Hogg finished at 10 and kicked the final penalty to seal victory.', 'It said everything about Wales’s performance that in the final 10 minutes, when they trailed by a point, they put no pressure on Scotland, and the scoreline did not reflect the difference between the sides. Alun Wyn Jones broke the record for the number of international caps with 150, but at times appeared alone in his resistance. The autumn should be the time for Pivac to assess his options looking towards the next World Cup, but after five successive defeats he needs a result.', '“No one likes losing but everyone goes through a patch in their career when they don’t win,” said the Wales wing Josh Adams. “It is how we come together as a team. We cannot dwell on this result with a new competition coming up. When your back is up against the wall it is about how you react.”']","Six Nations 2020","Sport","2020-11-02",9.49,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c03c882019c7b03259f6ee203b7fcb3f3ee25622/187_124_3253_1952/master/3253.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=98699949de2b49d048a76911d3c67b29","Scotland’s Stuart Hogg, whose kick made sure of victory against Wales, celebrates winning a penalty at Parc y Scarlets.

  ["Serena Williams battles burden of expectation before Simona Halep final","['Both Wimbledon finalists will be fighting their emotions in what should be a momentous duel, with the American well placed for a 24th slam']","['When Sabine Lisicki lost the final at Wimbledon to Marion Bartoli in 2013, she could not control the flow of tears that showed her desolation. Within 41 days Bartoli had retired, at only 28, after losing to Simona Halep in Cincinnati, unable to stand the aggregated pain of a long career, becoming the first Wimbledon champion not to defend her title since the 1969 winner, Ann Jones.', 'The antagonists in the final six years ago handled the aftermath in their own ways. Bartoli contemplated a comeback, thought better of it and found a home in the commentary box, while “Boom Boom” Lisicki, the fastest server in the game between 2014 and 2016 at 130mph, never quite got back the magic. At the Australian Open this year, and only 29, she went out in the first round of qualifying, for the third time on the spin at a slam.', 'This is a deceptively tough sport, as the finalists on Saturday know too well. Halep began to flower in the years that followed her defeat of Bartoli, to the point where she won the French Open last year and has reigned as No 1 in the world; Williams’s story is familiar to all, a tale of alternating glory and struggle that would seem to have at least a chapter or two left.', 'What they both share is a lingering fight with their emotions. Until Halep calmed her outer shell over the past couple of years, she was among the most volatile of competitors on the WTA Tour. Williams, as she admitted on Thursday after her best performance of the tournament – a 59-minute demolition of Barbora Strycova – cannot be sure from day to day how she will handle the pressures and expectations of her calling, even though she is by overwhelming consensus the finest player of her era.', 'Privately, she would agree with that. Good manners prevent her from saying so in public – and that brings its own baggage. When Williams was in place to record a calendar slam in the latter stages of the 2015 US Open, her emotions ran wild and she collapsed in a lachrymose cloud not dissimilar to the one that enveloped Lisicki, losing in the semi-finals to the Italian doubles artist Roberta Vinci.', 'And last September, again the red mist came down across her furious and disbelieving eyes as she railed against the perceived injustice heaped on her by the chair umpire Carlos Ramos and lost in the most theatrical exit. This week, in an article in Harper’s Bazaar, she reached out to her Flushing Meadows conqueror, Naomi Osaka, in a reprise of her case against Ramos, blaming the media for the furore.', 'Now she is returned to another statistical hell – or heaven, if she wins: victory on Saturday would give Williams her eighth Wimbledon singles title and her 24th major, matching the Australian Margaret Court for the most slams in the history of the sport. That is some achievement – yet Williams again is trying to downplay its significance, just as she did ahead of her match against Vinci four years ago.', 'She alternates between handling the responsibilities and rewards of greatness and being consumed by them. She should be comforted, though, by the evidence of her progress to the final, which contained only one glaring blip, when she fell over the line in three sets against Alison Riske. Her return to form in the semi-finals against Strycova was astonishing.', 'It could come down to a factor as obvious as the serve – and Serena, predictably, has a considerable edge here. No one in the draw has hit more than her 45 aces but, for someone who red-lines her power at around 120mph, she has logged surprisingly few double-faults: 11, in fact, which is a risk-reward ratio of about four to one.', 'Halep, however, is tied for 26 on the list with a clutch of others who have fallen, including Coco Gauff, who went out in the fourth round, and Belinda Bencic, a round earlier. But her risk-reward return is way poorer than Williams’s: nine aces, 12 double-faults.', 'The Romanian is no slouch with racket in hand, of course, but her fastest serve of the fortnight is 110mph – fully 12 miles an hour slower than the booming deliveries of her opponent.', 'Once that ball is in play, the return is vital and, if it is to be of any quality coming back at the American, Halep has to be brave, taking it on the rise occasionally, or making sure she delivers a heavy and precise enough blow from deep to keep the exchange alive. Only then is parity possible.', 'She is 15th on the tournament leaderboard for getting her return back, with 83%, and that is healthy. And here is the shock of the numbers: Williams lies tied for 66th in returns with 283 from 383, or 74%. That is exactly a hundred balls she has failed to get back in play when receiving and Halep will have taken that into account, no doubt.', 'After all that, it will be a surprise – not on the scale of her defeat by Vinci in New York – if Williams does not stand in the middle of Centre Court as the freshly crowned queen of Wimbledon, and the game itself.']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-12",16.33,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d98c8ed84224c56ba1670ff404351b6f2cb76b/0_99_1479_887/master/1479.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d17a0cd1392db579eb7046fe6b1cb86d","Serena Williams can switch between handling the responsibilities of greatness and being consumed by them.

Here there was sharpness at the net and confidence in moving to the volley that bore the signs of her mixed doubles campaign with Murray, and she will need all of that and more to beat Simona Halep in the final on Saturday.', 'As she put it after beating Strycova 6-1, 6-2 in 59 minutes: “I promise you, when I hit a volley I was like: ‘Would I have made that if I didn’t play doubles?’ I don’t think so. I kept telling you guys I thought the doubles would help me. I really think it did. I don’t attack the net that much. I tried to and I want to.', '“I know when I do, when I play doubles here with Venus, it definitely helps my singles game. I was really keen to play mixed here. I feel like it helped me, not just for today and this event but hopefully it will help me in the future.”', 'So, there is hope for Murray still to have another tilt at one of the game’s lesser titles, but one that plainly helped Williams on day 10. Tracy Austin, who won the mixed doubles title here in 1980, thinks so.', '“Playing mixed doubles with Andy Murray brought her intensity up,” the former world No 1 said in conversation with the BBC’s Sue Barker, “because we know how intense Andy is.”', 'Martina Navratilova observed of Williams’s win against the 33-year-old Czech: “Strycova was on the run every single shot. She defended to win her three games but that is all she had.”', 'Williams’s serve clicked near its best, delivering her the point 24 times out of 27 at the first attempt, nine from 17 when she needed a second serve, and striking 28 clear winners in such a short match, demonstrating how commanding she was.', 'Whether or not she can reproduce that brilliance against Halep, who beat the No 8 seed Elina Svitolina almost as impressively – 6-1, 6-3 in 1hr 13min – might depend on the American’s mood. As Williams admitted when reflecting on her relaxed demeanour: “I was calm today. It’s a day-to-day basis with me. We all know that. I’m far from perfect.”', 'That is patently true. It is 10 months since she lost all sense of proportion and discipline in losing the US Open final, although she insisted in an open letter this week to her conqueror, Naomi Osaka, that it was the media’s fault.', 'Ther was no friction here, though. All was well in the world and her smile was wide and generous. She revealed she had been thinking that morning about her journey, about motherhood, her post-match outfit, her first Wimbledon final, against her sister Venus in 2002, and about the number 24, the next hurdle to jump. Or did she?', '“I thought about it this morning,” she began, adding quickly: “I actually didn’t think about it, because it’s really not about 24 or 23 or 25. It’s just about going out there and giving my best effort, no matter what. No matter what I do, I will always have a great career. I don’t know … I just kind of let it go this morning. Yeah, I feel really calm about it.” Maybe she does.', 'Strycova, who looked in the form of her life defeating Johanna Konta on Tuesday, was philosophical, too, in defeat, full of admiration for the player Murray calls “one of the greatest of all time”. Strycova said: “I think it was her best match of all here. She was serving amazing. She was playing very deep, so I really couldn’t play the way I wanted to do.', '“If she will play like this in the final, it’s going to be very hard for Simona. But Simona has also her weapons.

  ["Wimbledon 2019: Halep ‘desperate’ for title after semi-final win over Svitolina","[' Former world No 1 attributes victory to new confidence on grass']","['Simona Halep has an air of contentment about her that should make anyone expecting another Serena Williams procession on Saturday think twice. Her mantra all season has been simple – “I just want to chill” – but behind her relaxed demeanour is the quiet confidence of a former world No 1 who knows she is at the top of her game.', 'After a cagey start to her semi-final victory over Elina Svitolina – the first two games took 20 minutes – Halep was far too strong for the Ukrainian eighth seed and she needed only another 43 minutes to seal a place in her first ever Wimbledon final. And considering she has already dumped out the 15-year-old breakout star Coco Gauff in the fourth round it would be naive to expect that a Centre Court crowd hoping to see Williams claim a historic 24th grand slam title will knock her out of her stride.', '“I’m desperate to win Wimbledon more than to stop her,” said Halep, the 2018 French Open champion. “I’m not thinking about her record. It’s a great feeling to face Serena in a grand slam final. If you are able to win, it makes it sweeter. If you lose, then you have to look forward for the next one. I have no pressure on myself, just a positive one. I have expectations for myself that I can do a great job. Still, I’m chilled.”', 'To watch Halep on court, “chilled” would not be the first word that springs to mind – she is certainly prone to the odd furious outburst – but off it she seems full of bonhomie. Inevitably she faced plenty of questions at the prospect of another clash with Williams, who knocked her out of this year’s Australian Open in three sets, but she covered an array of topics in her post-match press conference, ranging from why the British snooker player Mark Selby is one of just two people she follows on Twitter to why “the air from the beach” means Romania’s current crop all seem to be emerging from her home town of Constanta. “I have no idea how you play snooker but I appreciate [Mark]. He’s been in Romania a few times. I met him and also I have a snooker ball signed from him.”', 'Ultimately it becomes clear that a key reason for Halep’s laid-back approach to Wimbledon this year is that she finally feels comfortable on grass. That has not always been the case – even though she reached the 2014 semi-finals when an ankle injury hindered her chances of reaching the final – but this time she feels the penny has finally dropped.', '“This week I realised that I have a good chance on grass because I have strong legs, I can open the court,” she added. “The court works for me if I play the right tactic. When the ball is coming to me, now I know what to do with it. Maybe that’s why. Maybe I feel confident and I’m not scared any more of how the ball bounces.”', 'Working with a psychologist for the last two years has clearly helped too. “I started to learn how to keep the things simple because I overcomplicated everything in my head. I was thinking too much,” she said. “Sometimes I had too many options how to play and I didn’t pick the right one in the right moment.”', 'Throughout her march to the final Halep’s return of serve has stood out and Svitolina’s spirit was broken in those first two gruelling games, both won by Halep. The Ukrainian has been struggling with a knee injury this season which only added to the sense of inevitability once Halep had seized the initiative – so much so that Svitolina failed to hold serve in the opening set.', 'That Halep conceded only one point on her serve in the second set will give her confidence before facing Williams. She will also be buoyed by realising her mother’s dream in reaching the Wimbledon final here, admitting that she hopes Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, is among those in the Royal Box.', '“I talked to my mum after the match,” added Halep. “About 10 or 15 years ago she said her dream is [for me] to play the final at Wimbledon. She said I think it’s an unbelievable moment. So today her dream came true.”']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-11",14.23,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7912e883285dad7be312fddb5f764e137d00e221/0_155_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ba2111405b900e6e716ad5939213069a","Simona Halep is into her first Wimbledon final after victory over Elina Svitolina.

Throughout his 14-year professional career he has defied the odds and all expert opinion. He has invariably found a way.', 'None of his serial physical blows seemed to have killed his love of the game, although he came perilously close to walking away after his hip pain kicked in brutally in the first round of the Australian Open in January. One final operation saved his career.', 'It could hardly have been clearer from his demeanour on Centre Court on Saturday evening, when he and Williams laughed and smiled their way through an easy opening match, that he is convinced he made the right decision in carrying on.', 'The next challenge is to break out from the relatively undemanding world of doubles, in the men’s and mixed, to test himself in singles again. That could happen in Cincinnati in September as a dress rehearsal for a full return to the heat of competition at the US Open, where he won his first slam title seven years ago.', 'Much has happened since 2012 across the Tour as the rivals he grew up with have won their own struggles against injury and the ravages of time but Murray insists he can work his way back into that picture. “I know how bad I felt in Australia and how bad I felt the last year that I played singles here, and I feel better now than I did then,” he says.', 'His last singles appearance at Wimbledon, when he hobbled through five sets against Sam Querrey in 2017, mirrored the trauma of the Roberto Bautista Agut match in Melbourne but, as far as Murray is concerned, those experiences have been parked in the past. He has survived them and learned from the consequences.', '“If, physically, I can get back to a good level my tennis is still fine,” he says. “I’m sure that, tennis-wise, I will be able to keep up with guys. I don’t feel that the game has moved on and I won’t be able to get back. A lot of the same guys are still there.”', 'It has been starkly illustrated in the first week here that the expected rise of the young contenders in the men’s game is still in its early stages, as, one by one, they have fallen. The sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, went out in the first round along with the seventh, Stefanos Tsitsipas, followed by the Canadian teenager Félix Auger-Aliassime in the third round.', 'A slew of prospects and established seeds have failed to reach the second week. From one side of the draw alone Kevin Anderson, last year’s finalist and the fourth seed, has gone, along with the three-slam champion Stan Wawrinka, 10th seed Karen Khachanov, 11th seed Daniil Medvedev, as well as Britain’s Kyle Edmund. Gone also, after a fighting exit on Saturday night, is back-in-form Dan Evans.', 'On the other side of the draw notable casualties include Dominic Thiem, Nick Kyrgios, John Isner, Marin Cilic, Denis Shapovalov and Alex de Minaur. Still standing, of course, are Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, along with Kei Nishikori, the only top-10 players left.', 'Murray, meanwhile, is determined to play his one remaining card for as long as he can, having lost in the first round of the men’s doubles earlier on Saturday. But did he not miss the cut and thrust of high-grade singles, though? Yes and no.', '“It’s just different, singles and doubles. There is a lot more self-analysis in singles. It’s your responsibility. The thing that is nice with doubles is that, when you win, you are winning with someone else and that is enjoyable.', '“When me and Feli [López] won at Queen’s, we went out and bonded with each other, had dinner and that sort of stuff. In singles at the end of matches it is on you and that is the thing I’ve always had that is kind of different to doubles really.', '“At Queen’s, for example, we won the end of that final because of Feli. He played brilliant at the end of the match. So it is difficult to know how responsible you were for certain things. That’s the thing that is different about it that I am not used to as much.”', 'For all that he is enjoying his mixed doubles experiment with Williams, there is a murmur beneath that strongly suggests he cannot wait to get back to being a champion again – on his own.']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-07",22.3,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c708c9ac871fe100524409afd57418e4f01f3de8/439_210_2787_1672/master/2787.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8e41ed26e5bac60a42cb42dcb0fd21b7","Andy Murray is enjoying life on court again as a doubles player but is eyeing a return to singles.

Centre Court is an unfortunate setting for a bad day at the office and there was nowhere for the former world No 1 to hide when the wheels fell off, leaving her bemused audience to wonder if it was kinder to look away and let her suffer in private.', 'Rarely can Azarenka have experienced such a dramatic collapse. All Simona Halep had to do was wait for the former Australian Open champion to miss. And, boy, did she miss a lot, three double-faults and 33 unforced errors the tale of a 6-3, 6-1 defeat by Halep, who cannot have imagined her progress into the fourth round of Wimbledon would be so straightforward.', 'Remarkably Azarenka made the faster start, attacking the seventh seed’s serve to lead 3-1, but the world No 40 proceeded to lose 11 of the next 12 games and her low mood was summed up by the moment when she received a code violation for racket abuse at the end of the first set.', 'With Halep shifting uncomfortably up the other end, Azarenka stirred momentarily at the start of the second set. The ailing Belarusian toughed out a service game and soon earned a break point. But Halep saved it and the Romanian cruised to a focused victory.', 'Karolina Pliskova was happy to pass a tricky examination against the dizzyingly unusual game of Hsieh Su-wei, a player who struggles to find hitting partners because of her penchant for unorthodoxy. “You want to play normal tennis and not this tennis in practice,” Pliskova said earlier this week – and it was difficult to know if theNo 3 seed was complimenting Hsieh or aiming snark her way.', 'Whatever Pliskova’s intentions, her comment certainly added some edge to the opener on Centre Court. If nobody enjoys taking on Hsieh, it is because the 33-year-old from Chinese Taipei has worked to hone her style and is capable of executing it to cutting effect. At 5ft 7in she has to find ways of making the tour’s giants unsteady on their feet and she does so by throwing her opponents off with improvised guile, endless chopped slices and even the odd two-handed forehand. The combination is bewitching when it comes together.', 'This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.', 'Yet while Hsieh is an expert safe-cracker, the rangy Pliskova’s method of banging down doors with heavy groundstrokes and big serves tends to elicit greater rewards. Pliskova, triumphant at Eastbourne last week, should have a better record at SW19 – the former world No 1 has never made it past the fourth round – and she eventually sussed Hsieh out before winning 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.', '“She can make you feel ugly,” Pliskova said. “It’s tough to prepare because sometimes I don’t think she even knows what she’s going to play. You have to be ready for everything.”', 'Pliskova next plays another Czech after Karolina Muchova, the world No 68, used her variety to secure a polished 7-6 (7), 6-3 victory over Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit, the 20th seed.', 'There were strange scenes during Zhang Shuai’s surprising 6-4, 6-2 win over Caroline Wozniacki, who appeared to blame HawkEye for several lost points during her defeat by her unseeded Chinese opponent. “How are we playing with HawkEye that is this bad?” the 14th seed asked the umpire during the second set. “This is not fair. It’s so ridiculous. This is absurd. That one was far out, this one was maybe close, but it’s out. It’s crazy. Obviously it’s wrongly put.”', 'The umpire appeared to sympathise with the Dane when he said: “I understand your point but there is nothing I can do. We have to go with that.”', 'Wozniacki, who lost her way after squandering a 4-0 lead in the first set and an early break in the second, was somewhat more diplomatic after the match. “I thought there were a few ones that I saw way differently,” said the 28-year-old. “But it is what it is. You can’t really change a HawkEye call. Maybe it was right. I just saw it differently. But you trust HawkEye normally. You trust that it tells you the right thing.', '“Sometimes you do see the balls a little differently than what the HawkEye is. At least you know you can get it out of your mind.

The mixed doubles draw had landed. And there it was, confirmation of a historic partnership: Andy Murray, feminist and all-round good guy, to play with Serena Williams, the American he calls “one of the best tennis players of all time”.', 'This once-in-a-lifetime show will, the All England Club hope, run for longer than their first-round match against Germany’s Andreas Mies and the American-born Chilean Alexa Guarachi. “Alexa? What are the odds of Murray and Williams reaching the second week?” “I’m sorry. I don’t understand the question.”', 'The first part of the question was not answered until late on Tuesday, about 15 hours before the entry deadline, when Murray and Williams stopped teasing everyone and announced they were an item. His courting of the women’s Tour was looking forlorn until then, as texts and phone calls crisscrossed the strange Tinder world of doubles, where relationships can last as long as cream on a strawberry.', 'As is his nature, Murray agonised over his commitment to both forms of doubles as if he were picking a birthday present for his mother. He said after practice on Wednesday: “We chatted about it for a couple of days. I know she had had problems with her knee this year and both sides wanted to see how her match [against Giulia Gatto-Monticone] went before we did the final part. She felt fine [serving up to 125mph] and I saw her briefly today. She seems like she is up for it.', '“With everything that has gone on the last couple of years, you don’t know what’s coming next. The opportunity to play with Serena, one of the best tennis players of all time and one of the greatest female athletes ever – it’s something that I may never get another chance to do. And I might not play mixed doubles again so, if I’m going to do it once, the chance to play with her is brilliant.”', 'Murray earlier in the week talked about how the grand slam tournaments could boost doubles – both versions – by cutting matches to three sets and revive the profile it had in the days when John McEnroe was a regular with Peter Fleming, when the singles stars regularly tried their hand at a two-hander.', '“It [would] be a positive thing for tennis if more guys were playing doubles,” he said. “But here it’s difficult because of the format, the best-of-five sets. I would never expect a top singles player to enter the doubles here because playing potentially 10 sets in one day is just too much. That’s something that would be worth looking at, to give more value to the doubles event, to get more of the top singles players playing, reduce the length of the matches.”', 'That went down like lukewarm punch with Richard Lewis, chief executive of the All England Club, but he is a forward-thinker always open to persuasion – especially if the best player in the nation’s history is talking.', 'There has not been this much interest in mixed doubles at Wimbledon since Murray’s elder brother, Jamie, broke through for the family at the highest level in 2007, when he and Jelena Janković won the title. Actually, his second win in the discipline, with Martina Hingis two years ago –when they beat Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen in the final – probably matched it.', 'Jamie and Serena’s compatriot, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, are in the bottom half of the draw.

But, if he is to further confound the doubters and lift another Wimbledon title, his 101st win at the All England Club will have to be his 16th against Rafael Nadal when they meet in the semi-finals on Friday in their 40th contest. That will be an altogether different proposition.', '“We have a lot of information on Rafa and so does he on us,” Federer said. “You can dive into all that stuff or say this is grasscourt tennis and just attack. It was a joy to play against Rafa at Roland Garros [where Nadal won their semi-final in straight sets on his favoured clay]. I go about it like every other match.”', 'Nadal, who has won here twice (including their memorable 2008 final), has fallen in love with the Wimbledon grass again after years of poor results.

On Wednesday, he beat Sam Querrey 7-5, 6-2, 6-2.', 'Whoever wins that semi-final will almost certainly face Djokovic, who was awesome again in thrashing poor David Goffin in three quick sets earlier in the day. Barring the Serb’s way to the final is the 23rd seed, Roberto Bautista Agut, who has beaten him twice this year, on hardcourts in Miami and Doha, so he is dangerous. But Djokovic will start a prohibitive favourite in that match.', 'So here they are again, the Big Three, gathered around the biggest prize in the game. In the fourth round, they gave up just 19 games between them; on Wednesday, the total rose to 30. But they are peerless. For all the talk that they were about to bow to youth at these championships they continue to set the standard, a remarkable dominance.', 'Nevertheless, only once have they all gone into the Wimbledon semi‑finals together, in 2007, when Nadal defeated Djokovic and then lost against Federer in the final. Federer is the oldest at 37 and there were fleeting moments at the beginning of his match when he looked it.', 'When Nishikori – appearing in his fifth grand slam quarter‑final in succession – nailed the first set after 40 minutes the hush in the seats told the story: their hero was struggling.', 'Of course, they kept the faith and the backlash in the second set was swift – for the loss of a single game in 22 minutes – but the grind resumed before Federer got it done in two hours and 36 minutes.', '“It was difficult,” Federer admitted courtside. “The beginning was brutal. Kei came out and was smashing winners; he was the better player. So it was important to get the lead and protect it, then start a normal match at one set all. I served really good and protected that until the very end.”', 'As for his century of Wimbledon victories, he said: “You’re not thinking hundred, hundred. A fan told me. It was a sweet way to do it. The crowd were so nice.”', 'They are never less than nice. Their love for Federer is boundless. And he appreciates it more than people realise. In an interesting aside later, the Swiss was asked how much time he spends alone.', '“Not much,” Federer said, pausing. “I don’t like being alone. I mean, I’m not afraid of being alone. I like being surrounded by my friends, family. It’s obviously the best. I like talking to people. Now, with four kids anyway, there is a lot of that, which is perfect for me in my life because I’m very happy.”']","Wimbledon 2019","Sport","2019-07-10",20.18,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b1dd04f351813a05464cde3d8ce368f14a0475e/0_13_5016_3011/master/5016.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=ab82bc82d7b6fad35a5c87c1680033b0","Roger Federer recovered from dropping the first set to beat Kei Nishikori comfortably in their quarter-final.

  ["Lewis Hamilton closes on Schumacher's record after winning Belgian Grand Prix","['Mercedes driver leads every lap from pole position to win race', 'Valtteri Bottas second and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen third']","['If the challenge of the glorious 19 corners and sweeping high-speed elevation changes of the Spa‑Francorchamps circuit are beloved by fans and drivers alike, Lewis Hamilton tamed them almost to the point of mundanity in winning the Belgian Grand Prix.', 'The world champion’s victory was another masterclass in dominant control and flawless execution, operating on a level rapidly suggesting this season at least he is untouchable. Spa is a classic track, a drivers’ circuit testing bravery and judgment. Hamilton made it look easy.', 'He was unchallenged throughout, leading and dictating the race with relentless efficiency from pole. His Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas was second but never threatened, while Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was the only driver to stay with the two leaders and took third.', 'Ferrari’s difficult season reached a low point with Sebastian Vettel finishing 13th and Charles Leclerc 14th. The Scuderia were left flailing in the forests of the Ardennes and face intense pressure going into what amounts to two home grands prix in two weeks at Monza and Mugello. The absence of massed ranks of the tifosi may turn out to be a blessing.', 'Hamilton, however, had been in consummate control from the off. So much so that he was largely in a race of his own. Indeed he felt almost apologetic afterwards as he returned his fifth win of the season. The similarity to his authoritative victory in Spain at the last round was notable. Hamilton conceded the level at which he and his team are operating is making these races seem almost as series of fait accompli.', '“I know it is not what everyone wants to see, a Mercedes at the front,” Hamilton said. “But no matter how much success we have we just keep our heads down. Back at the office, there are no guys celebrating. It is all about how we can win the next race.”', 'Verstappen, once more unable to challenge for the lead but a country mile clear of the rest of the pack, had another lonely race in third and gave a blunt assessment of how the pecking order in F1 pans out on one of the greatest race tracks in the world. “It was pretty boring. Not much to do. I couldn’t keep up with them when they started pushing,” he said. “It was not really enjoyable out there today. It was a bit lonely.”', 'Part of the issue here is Mercedes have emerged this season with a car and engine combination that has once again given them a definitive edge over their rivals. But in Hamilton’s hands it is proving to be a devastating weapon that is setting him apart. He was half a second clear of Bottas in qualifying, bringing a finesse to the single lap that is proving unmatchable. Then in race pace he has too much for his nearest rival, his teammate in the same machinery.', 'The Finn has few chances and in Spa he had two and could not capitalise on either. Verstappen in turn is extracting the maximum but Red Bull are yet to close to the pace of that Mercedes out front. The world champion does not chase numbers but he has them adding up this season like never before. His 89th career win and his fourth at Spa, ended the run of recent Ferrari victories at the circuit and put him in touching distance of Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 wins, a tally he could equal at Mugello in two weeks’ time. He is also well on course to match Schumacher’s record of seven championships, enjoying a very comfortable advantage in the title race, leading the championship with 157 points, in front of Verstappen on 110 and Bottas on 107.', '', '1 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes GP 157pts2 Max Verstappen (Ned) Red Bull 1103 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes GP 1074 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 485 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 456 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 457 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 428 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 339 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 3310 Esteban Ocon (Fra) Renault 2611 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 2312 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Scuderia AlphaTauri 1813 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1614 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Racing Point 615 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo Racing 216 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia AlphaTauri\\xa017 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas F1 118 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo Racing 019 Nicholas Latifi (Can) Williams 020 George Russell (Gbr) Williams 021 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas F1 0', '', 'For Ferrari, who won the last two races here in Spa with dominant victories delivered through their straightline speed advantage, the meeting has been a traumatic, sobering experience. Their engine is down on power after the FIA clarified specific engine regulations to Ferrari late last season and they feared being under the cosh in Spa with their power deficit and so it proved. Way down from the leaders in practice, and struggling in the first and third sectors, they lack speed, and struggled with making the tyres work leading to a lack of grip. After qualifying in 13th and 14th, the race offered no respite, nor improvement in positions. Leclerc won here last year but this time they faced no little ignominy in Vettel being easily passed by the customer Ferrari-engined Alfa Romeo of Kimi Raikkonen for a place outside even the points.', 'At the sharp end it was a different story. Hamilton made a clean start into La Source and held off Bottas on the run through Eau Rouge, any chance the Finn had of mugging his teammate on the opening lap had gone by the time they emerged on to the Kemmel straight. With Hamilton having opened a familiar gap Bottas’s only other chance came after the restart caused by a safety car after Antonio Giovinazzi had a major accident taking out George Russell. Neither was harmed but when racing resumed once again Hamilton held his lead and the clean air out front.', 'It was unspectacular as he conceded but he is performing in perfect harmony with what is proving to be a relentlessly efficient tool. Hamilton’s sights are set on another title, nothing at Spa suggested he can be diverted from securing it sooner rather than later.', 'Daniel Ricciardo was fourth for Renault and his teammate Esteban Ocon in fifth.

  ["South African teams eclipse Australia's Super Rugby efforts","['Form so far this season indicates a competitive Springboks team could be assembled by just selecting players from domestic franchises']","['There have been reports South Africa will leave Sanzaar after the 2023 World Cup to play in an expanded Six Nations tournament – but perhaps the Springboks can have the best of both worlds. The country is committed to Sanzaar until 2025, but that arrangement does not necessarily need to be a barrier to its northern ambitions. ', 'South Africa is uniquely placed as a southern hemisphere superpower which lies in the European timezone, which means the Springboks have the potential to play in both the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship. ', 'That might sound fanciful, but consider this: in the early 1990s the Lithuanian basketball team toured Australia to play a series of games against the Boomers. At the same time Lithuania played in an international tournament in Europe. How did the Lithuanians achieve this seemingly impossible task? They simply selected two different teams.', 'South Africa is in a position to do likewise with the Springboks. They already have a footprint in Europe with the Cheetahs and Southern Kings – re-located from Super Rugby when the competition was reduced from 18 teams to 15 in 2018 – playing in the Guinness PRO 14. Many of South Africa’s 2019 World Cup-winning Springboks are playing for English and French clubs too.', 'This means South Africa possesses a pool of talent in Europe to draw on to select a competitive Springboks team to play in the Six Nations. Similarly, they would be capable of assembling another competitive Springboks team from its Super Rugby franchises to play in the Rugby Championship.', 'The South Africans could field similar teams in the July and November Test windows, while a re-unified Springboks team could play at the World Cup.', 'There have only been two rounds of Super Rugby this season, but indications are South Africa could put together a very good Springboks team by just selecting players from its domestic franchises. ', 'So far South African teams have won three of the four Super Rugby games they have played against non-South African opposition. The Stormers beat the Hurricanes 27-0 in Cape Town; the Sharks defeated the Highlanders 42-20 in Dunedin; and the Lions downed the Reds 27-20 in Johannesburg.', 'This compares favourably with the efforts of the Australian teams who failed to beat any non-Australian opposition in the first two rounds. Apart from the Reds losing to the Lions, the Melbourne Rebels were upset 36-27 by the Sunwolves in Fukuoka, while the NSW Waratahs lost to the Crusaders 43-25 in Nelson and to the Blues 32-12 in Newcastle.', 'It is early days, of course, but if this trend continues the consequences for Australian rugby – on and off the field – could be dire. It was only a few years ago, in the 2017 Super Rugby season, that no Australian team won any games against New Zealand opposition. The way things are looking at the moment most of the Australian teams will struggle to win any games against either New Zealand or South African sides.', 'The Brumbies are the only Australian team to have won any games at all so far with both of their wins against the Reds (27-24) and Rebels (39-26) coming at the expense of fellow Australian sides. While the Brumbies are only one of four teams to remain undefeated after the first two rounds, their real test will come when they play the Highlanders in Canberra on Friday night.', 'The well-drilled Brumbies may not be at the same level as the Crusaders or the Chiefs, but they should be able to compete with the other New Zealand and South African teams. If they are to do so, they will need to improve their defence, having missed 21 tackles against the Rebels.', 'What about the other Australian teams? Will they beat any New Zealand or South African opposition this season? Or the Jaguares or Sunwolves for that matter? The Reds have been competitive in their two losses to the Brumbies and the Lions, they just do not seem to know how to win.', 'But the Waratahs and the Rebels have been plain awful. The Waratahs attracted their lowest ever crowd – 7,491 – when they lost to a depleted Blues team which had 10 players unavailable, including All Blacks backs Beauden Barrett and Rieko Ioane. It was a wet night in Newcastle, but the Waratahs need to start winning or their long-suffering fans will continue to abandon them. Likewise, the Rebels.', 'At least one of these under-performing teams will notch a win when they play each other in Melbourne on Friday night – unless it is a draw.

  ["Getafe tear Valencia apart and rip up the cliches as they climb ever higher","['José Bordalás’s side are third after beating a far wealthier rival for a European place to a pulp. What they are doing is absurd']","['“Mission accomplished,” José Bordalás said. It was six o’clock on Saturday 8 February and Getafe’s manager reckoned they had reached their target. “Not mathematically,” he conceded, sitting there at the Coliseum where another team had been thrown to the lions, “but virtually.” Outside, 13,070 supporters had spent the afternoon serenading him, singing “Bordalás, I love you” as Getafe beat Valencia, the club whose centre forward cost twice as much as their entire starting XI. And no wonder: two goals from Jorge Molina and one from Jaime Mata took them to 42 points, securing another season in primera for the team he took over in the relegation zone, second bottom.', 'Of segunda.', 'Up from the second, into the first, staying there twice and safe again with 15 matches still to go, time for some other target then. They won’t say so, not publicly at least, but it’s not just the league Getafe aspire to be in next season; it’s the Champions League too. And while they have been here before – last year, they missed out on the final day, 22 minutes of which they spent in fourth – this time they’re even better placed than before. More importantly, it’s still absurd. Just doing what they did to Valencia is pretty silly.', 'Valencia-Getafe is a very modern rivalry and a startlingly bitter one too, built on recriminations, emerging swiftly and embraced deeply. There has been fighting talk and actual fighting. Last season’s Copa del Rey tie, won in the last minute by Valencia, turned into full-on battle where there genuinely was blood, sweat and tears, and when Getafe lost that last Champions League place it was to Valencia. Yet Bordalás insisted that didn’t make Saturday’s win taste better – although for the fans it probably did – and nor is that why Valencia manager Albert Celades referred to Getafe as “direct rivals”. Instead, it was because this was third against fifth, two points apart, making it a match of huge significance. “We’re competing for the same thing,” Celades said.', 'They shouldn’t be. Valencia’s salary cap, set by the league (the total amount they are allowed to spend on their playing staff, transfers and wages included), is €170m. Getafe’s is €56m. Eleven teams have a bigger budget; Barcelona and Madrid’s annual revenue is 16 times theirs. The 14 men who played on Saturday cost €16.2m. Maxi López cost €30m. So did Rodrigo Moreno. Getafe’s most expensive player is Nemanja Maksimovic, who Valencia didn’t want. In the winter window they lost their first-choice centre-back to bottom-placed Espanyol, for goodness sake.', '“I tell my players that they should believe, that they should set their own limits, not let anyone else do that for them; I try to get them to see that they have talent, that they can do it, tell them that players at big clubs are no better than them,” Bordalás said. But they’re supposed to be.', 'Getafe’s real, original rivalry is with Leganés, built on gravel pitches in regional football to the south of Madrid and somehow established in primera. Coming up to 38, officially the captain is older than the club he plays for: when Molina signed, at 34, seemingly on the way down, he thought he’d never reach the first division again. His strike partner, Mata, scoring goals as a student but never really seeing this as a career, didn’t think he would ever get there at all. The other striker, Ángel, was 30 when he signed, unexpectedly getting the chance to go back. The year before Damián Suárez joined, he was relegated with Elche and in his first year at Getafe was relegated again. When Xabi Exteita signed this summer, it was from relegation with Huesca. Allan Nyom had just gone down with West Brom. And on it goes: 28 relegations the squad have endured between them.', 'And yet on Saturday – on any given Sunday, in fact – Bordalás was right. They are no worse than players at bigger clubs. In fact, they are better. In the case of Valencia, miles better. At the end of Saturday’s game, standing at the touchline having been beaten, it took Valencia defender Gabriel five or six seconds to say anything, the silence deafening, a lost look in his eyes, like a broken man. “I can’t say anything …” he eventually mumbled, trying to bite his tongue. When at last he did, he said: “It was shit, all of it. Everything was shit.” Which was true, but that’s what Getafe do to a lot of teams.', 'Besides, if everything Valencia did was shit, everything Getafe did was brilliant. They didn’t just defeat Valencia, they took them to pieces; in doing so, they took the cliches to pieces too.', 'It finished 3-0. It could have been four, five, six or more. “Bish, bash, bosh” read the headline in AS, which summed it up quite nicely, Valencia beaten to a pulp, except it was more subtle than that. “Boring,” “dirty,” defensive Getafe, the “anti-football” team who actually spend more time in the opposition half than anyone else in Spain, had 22 shots. They had 10 on target and nine corners. Valencia didn’t have any of either. They had more of the ball, more passes, more crosses, more dribbles, more everything except fouls. They’re tough it’s true, and at times maybe it isn’t easy on the eye, skilled at the “other football”, but they can play, like Bordalás says. Last week at Athletic, Damián Suárez turned all Leo Messi. This week, Molina turned all Denis Bergkamp. Turned all the Valencia defence too, leaving them in a cartoon knot, knees facing backwards, legs wrapped round each other.', 'Molina’s second goal was superb, “a work of art” Bordalás said, a mess of Valencia defenders sent out for cigarettes: a shift one way, yoo-hoo, bye, a shift the other, and it was in the net. But it wasn’t about that; it was about everything. It was that while the first dropped to him from a rebound, he had made the opportunity in the first place, the third he had made in five minutes; that while it might have been a potty-mouthed guiri, or foreigner, who called him “so fucking good” on the radio, far from reproach the line, the presenter repeated it. Molina stops the clock, master of time and space, magically appearing around him. Hold, wait, apply the pause and then the pass, something from nothing. There is no better slow-motion dribbler, defenders lulled then defeated, so smooth, almost silent, no better way out.', '“He’s like El Cid, everyone follows him,” Bordalás said, making Molina blush. “The feeling is reciprocated,” Molina said, smiling softly. Everything is and it is all of them. Just look at the forwards: Molina has been wonderful; Mata got a Spain call-up; this week, the talk in Getafe was that Barcelona were coming for Ángel. Cucurella, Arambarri, Maksimovic, Djené, Soria and stop there … it wouldn’t be fair to keep going and leave anyone out.', 'Bordalás certainly won’t. He was quick to highlight Ángel’s role in the third. Getafe’s top scorer on nine goals, eight of them off the bench, Ángel had the chance to get another but instead rolled it across for Mata to score. There was something in that, a portrait of his team, just as there was something in the fact that most of his players actually ran the other way to celebrate with Kenedy – another substitute and the man whose tackle, not exactly the thing he is known for, had started it all off. “This team is super-generous; I appreciate the work, the attitude, the solidarity. We’re a family. This team is an example of generosity, an example of football,” Bordalás said.', 'It is his example, his obsession. When Bordalás arrived just over three years ago, Getafe were near the foot of the second division. He took them to promotion, then to eighth, then fifth. Now, they’re safe again with 15 weeks to go. Intense, demanding, a little mad but with method, once seen as unsuited to the first division, too unsubtle for the top flight, what he has done is extraordinary. He has revived them all, moulding what might seem to be a motley crew into a hugely impressive football team, achieving beyond their wildest dreams.', 'Between them, his players have played more seasons in the second division than first and have experienced more relegations than they have winners’ medals, three times as many as they have league titles – and none of those are in Europe’s five biggest leagues. Only two of them are even in Europe, in fact: there’s an apertura and a clausura with River Plate, a Cameroonian title with Cotton Sport, two leagues with Dynamo Kyiv, two in Kazakhstan and that’s that. Yet here they are, third: ahead of Atlético and Sevilla, now five points and an unassailable head-to-head record ahead of Valencia, their 21st century rivals for whom, like most first division teams, they should be no match', 'Saturday’s starting XI has played just seven Champions League games ever, but that could change. As Molina put it: “it’s not chance.” If they might not be the third best team in Spain right now, it might only be because they’re the second. They have won four in a row without conceding a goal and although Barcelona and Sevilla are up next, plus Ajax in the Europa League, although there is a long way to go, safety has been secured for another season, leaving something greater before them. It will be hard, but if Getafe are anything it is hard, built to do what they can’t.', '“We don’t talk about that, day to day,” Bordalás said. “But you always dream, grow, improve, try to achieve big things. Today we played a team with a budget that is far, far greater than our own and we won with authority. I tell them: let’s enjoy this, keep working, because as soon as you stop, it ends, and see what happens next. There’s a very long way to go. We’re on a crossing, swimming. We’ve passed the equator and we can see the beach now. Don’t give up yet; keep on swimming until you reach the shore.”', 'Alavés 2–1 Eibar, Levante 2–0 Leganés, Getafe 3–0 Valencia, Valladolid 1–1 Villarreal, Atlético 1–0 Granada, Espanyol 1–0 Mallorca, Real Sociedad 2–1 Athletic, Osasuna 1–4 Madrid, Celta 2–1 Sevilla, Betis 2–3 Barcelona']","La Liga","Sport","2020-02-10",16.22,"Mon","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca59be51fb4050af790f1b28b2c9553de4a6acce/0_7_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=bc1f62107ab56531ef7d6f04f16303b1","Jorge Molina celebrates after scoring one of two goals against Valencia in the 3-0 win.

  ["Murrayfield atmosphere reflected rising noise, bile and spite in rugby union","['Six Nations sees respect jettisoned for ill-feeling, as evidenced by Eddie Jones’s name-calling and fans jeering goalkickers']","['Few sports tread the fine line between love and hate as precariously as rugby union. It is part of its attraction: beauty and the beast occupy the same arena, passion and restraint are essential requirements. What has traditionally bound everything together is the realisation that, ultimately, it is a game that relies not only on the “rugby” for its enduring appeal but the collective power of “union”.', 'Essentially it boils down to a single word: respect. The code used to be simple: regardless of the intensity of the contest, be respectful to the referee, your opponents and the game itself. Increasingly, though, rugby is drifting in the opposite direction. Abusing the goalkickers, gesticulating at officials, booing players from a rival nation off the bus and blaming the media have become an all-too familiar part of the Six Nations backdrop.', 'It would be simple to file all this away under the heading “modern life” and criticise keyboard warriors on Twitter for helping to coarsen the atmosphere around top-level rugby – simple but a shade too convenient because it is about time rugby woke up to the self-inflicted damage being done by some within the game who should know better, not least coaches who overlook the link between their pre-match rhetoric and deteriorating relationships elsewhere.', 'When Eddie Jones talked about inflicting “absolute brutality” on France and dismissed the Scots as “niggly” one can be sure some of his employers at the Rugby Football Union were among those rolling their eyes. It helps to fuel the kind of atmosphere that, along with the wind and the rain, made its presence keenly felt at Murrayfield on Saturday when England were jeered on arrival and their captain Owen Farrell was booed when he kicked for goal.', 'Friendly rivalry is fine; centuries of history cannot be entirely rewritten, after all. But as the former Scotland international Peter Brown wrote in a thundering letter to the Times last week: “Hate is for terrorists. Not rugby players.”', 'Disliking someone based purely on their nationality is the most blinkered of traits; such intolerance is nothing to shout about. Stranded in Edinburgh by the weather over the weekend three of us were scooped up by two extremely kind rescuers, a Dutchman living in Ascot and a South African resident in Singapore. A seven-hour shared car odyssey and hundreds of miles of rugby chat later, it felt as if we had known each other for years.', 'Maybe it would help if more players were also encouraged to see the benefits of engaging with the media, to look past the occasional wince-inducing headline and recognise the opportunity to project themselves, both as athletes and as human beings. It might give some of them a more rounded perspective.', 'There is a massive amount to admire about Ellis Genge: his talent, his dynamism, his honesty and his refusal to be constrained by the perceptions of others. But when he dismisses “the sausages” who aired uncomplimentary views about England after the French game only to say nicer things post-Murrayfield, he is straying on to trickier terrain. Does that mean only he, Ellis, can tell it like it is? Is he saying the former internationals who were critical of the Parisian performance know nothing? Honesty at the top level is a two-way street.', 'At times it is easier said than done. One minute players are expected to be singing their hearts out during the anthems, the next to be completely calm. Or to smash their opponent into the middle of next week before getting up and calling the referee “sir”. It must occasionally be galling to listen to a coach or captain whose back you were protecting until recently delivering home truths from a well-remunerated pundit’s chair.', 'Maybe there are just too many podcasts, with too many babbling voices competing to be the noisiest, most controversial or the most indiscreet. Either way, there is way too much impatience and intolerance swilling around which, in turn, threatens the umbilical cord linking the game with its public.', 'Johnny Sexton is surely destined to become the best referee in the world, so often does he lecture those mere mortals currently trying to do the job. Jones writes disparagingly in his autobiography about the media “lunch club” and their “astounding vanity” without bothering to name names. Finn Russell savages Gregor Townsend’s coaching regime mid-tournament, in apparent retribution for the lack of understanding he believes has been shown towards him. Can they both be right? It is that same blurry fine line again, this time between free speech and fair comment.', 'No one wants rugby to become one big ocean of blandness. Then again, it is already tough enough not to require unnecessary bile and spite. Nor is it about people trying to cling to some absurd notion of moral superiority over other sports, as if that were ever true. It is more about people recognising they do not reside in some kind of bubble. Silence for kickers is fine but not if they take forever lining it up. If you make disparaging remarks about a rival nation at a press conference, do not then complain when someone abuses you in the street or on a train.', 'The presence of the remarkable Doddie Weir at Murrayfield was a timely reminder of what a real rugby ambassador looks like. If only out of respect for inspiring people like him, the trash talking has to stop.', 'On the touchline at the U20 international between Scotland and England at Myreside on Friday night, everyone was saying the same thing. “Look at the size of them,” muttered the spectator behind me. “They’re all absolutely massive.” He was not just talking about England, who traditionally love a big forward at age-group level, but the home side, too. Watching Scotland’s 6ft 2in tall fly-half, Nathan Chamberlain, up against England’s full-back Freddie Steward, who stands over 6ft 4in and weighs 101kg (15st 9lb), was to suspect Eddie Jones may be correct to predict the sport will become more and more about power. It will become an infinitely poorer game if smaller playmakers are all but squeezed out.', 'Here’s hoping that this year’s Women’s Six Nations is remembered for more than just one decisive opening round win by England over France and a lack of hot showers for Wales’s frozen players in Ireland at the weekend. The good news is that the media rights for the women’s games are to be sold under the same umbrella as the men’s international schedule from next season, hopefully ensuring better scheduling, more visibility and greater remuneration for those involved.

  ["Will small-ball eventually put an end to the NBA 7-footer?","['The Houston Rockets have begun playing without a center, and they are winning games. But there is still a place for the big man in basketball']","['Last month, the Houston Rockets took the NBA’s small-ball revolution to its logical extreme, defeating the Dallas Mavericks 128-121 without a player listed as taller than 6ft 6in. According to records, it was the first time an NBA team had done so since the 1963 Chicago Zephyrs beat the New York Knicks. The Chicago Zephyrs, for the record, were what the Washington Wizards used to be called three cities and four name changes ago. A lot has changed since then, but considering the evolution of the league, it was probably only a matter of time before a team repeated the Zephyrs’ feat.', 'How did the Rockets end up playing like this?', 'The Rockets’ starting center, the 6ft 10in Clint Capela, was injured, which left them with just reserve big men Tyson Chandler and Isaiah Hartenstein. Head coach Mike D’Antoni, never one to shy away from a controversial decision, left both of them on the bench. Instead, the Rockets played 6ft 5in PJ Tucker at center and opened up the offense in order to give James Harden and Russell Westbrook as much space as they wanted.', 'Were there any downsides to the Rockets playing so small?', 'Not if you ask Dallas’s 7ft 3in Kristaps Porzingis. With nobody on court to effectively challenge the center in the paint, he scored a season-high 35 points on 12-for-20 shooting. As you might imagine given the Rockets’ super-small lineup, the Mavericks also outrebounded the Rockets 52-37.', 'That sounds bad for Houston…', 'Well, the Rockets also managed to outscore the Mavericks while Porzingis was on the court. Shot selection might have been a factor, as Porzingis only attempted four three-pointers despite being an effective long-distance shooter. No team knows the value of the three-pointer more than the Rockets, you can pretty much see the story of the seven-point victory in the final three-point tallies: the Mavericks went 14-for-36, while the Rockets went 21-45.', 'Is it just me, or does everything in the NBA look a bit smaller these days?', 'It’s not just you. For a good chunk of its history, the NBA revolved around the center: there’s a reason that the position was called that in the first place. The Dominant Big Man was so key that their names came to define their eras: think George Mikan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O’Neal at his peak. These days, the key players around the league tend to be smaller, faster wings and forwards, with centers falling relatively low on the list of priorities when teams are building their rosters.', 'What has changed?', 'Well, much of it has to do with the growing importance of the three-point line. Although introduced in the league in the 1979-80 season, it took some time for teams to adapt to its existence and come to terms with the mathematical reality that shots worth three points were more valuable than those worth two. Eventually, though, teams started to de-emphasize the mid-range shot. With rare exceptions – Porzingis happens to be one of them – centers don’t tend to be the kind of sharp-shooters valued in the modern NBA.', 'It wasn’t just the three-pointer though. There’s a strong argument that the offensive explosion that we’ve seen in recent years was the result of defensive rule changes the league made at the start of the 21st century. The introduction of the three-second violation and an increased crackdown on hand-checking sped up the tempo of the game and helped make the stationary big man an endangered species.', 'So is the increased emphasis on small-ball just a result of rule changes?', 'Even if the NBA remained unchanged, it’s likely that we would have still seen a decrease in the importance of the big man. Over the last few decades, players have become quicker, more athletic and – this is key – more versatile. The center is starting to decline because positional differences themselves are less meaningful. This is reflected in the NBA All-Star Game, where voters no longer choose between forwards and centers but rather “frontcourt players.” In the past, a player’s physical type determined what role they played, but that’s no longer necessarily the case.', 'The level of competition alone would have altered the game. Yahoo! Sports’s Kelly Dwyer probably put this best in a piece he wrote about the center back in 2012, “at some point, even the quickest-thinking and quickest-spinning big men can’t keep up. And I don’t think that’s a problem … It wasn’t the centers that got smaller. It was the game that got bigger. And better.”', 'Can we expect the Rockets to keep this experiment going?', 'Apparently! On Thursday’s trade deadline, they dealt Capela to the Atlanta Hawks in a four-way deal, in which the tallest player they received was 6ft 9in small forward Robert Covington. As of now, Hartenstein and Chandler are the only true big men on the roster. That night they were playing the Western Conference-leading Los Angeles Lakers and the Rockets ended up stunning the Lakers at home, beating them 121-111. Westbrook, in particular, thrived in the undersized lineup, scoring 41 points. Maybe they could be on to something here.', 'Did that momentum carry over to their next game?', 'It very much did not. The next night, the Rockets suffered their worst loss of the season to the Utah Jazz. To be fair, they were resting Westbrook on the second night of back-to-back games.', 'Could the Rockets be ushering in a change in the league?', 'Let’s see how “very-small-ball” goes when opponents have had time to gameplan around it. The Rockets also happen to have a superb talent in Harden, who is the most efficient scorer in the game. They have teamed him with Westbrook, maybe the only other player who is as ball-dominant as Harden. Even if they manage to have playoff success with this kind of lineup, it’s not a formula that’s easy to replicate without players like Harden and Westbrook.', 'The era of the Dominant Big is probably gone for good, but size will always be valuable in the NBA. In an essay for FiveThirtyEight, Jared Dubin points out that, despite the Golden State Warriors’ success in recent years, contending teams are already starting to pivot back to the two big-man lineups. Most notably, the Philadelphia 76ers signed power forward/center Al Horford to play alongside their star center, Joel Embiid. While Philadelphia are still ironing out the kinks in this arrangement, the attempt alone shows that NBA teams remain unafraid to bet big.']","Houston Rockets","Sport","2020-02-11",9,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11b8a9436b9f01254648d89b4b4f3944b80c1c9/0_0_3640_2184/master/3640.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4130b2c1b0a3255754131441a7ec3557","Houston Rockets guard Russell Westbrook drives to the basket during the NBA basketball game against the Dallas Mavericks in Houston.

  ["England may need to manage Jofra Archer differently, admits Silverwood","[' England coach says Archer may bowl shorter spells']","['Chris Silverwood has conceded for the first time he may look at managing Jofra Archer differently in Test cricket. The England coach said he could use Archer in shorter spells than has been the case but, if the situation demanded, he would still ask the paceman to bowl 40 overs in an innings.', '“Things like [bowling 40 overs] we have to look at,” Silverwood said. “But sometimes, when needs must, you’ve got to do it. We managed Mark Wood through both the Test matches he’s played here and he’s bowled in short sharp spells. Would we look to do that now with Jof? Yes, we probably would.”', 'Asked if there was any aspect of Archer’s handling he would alter if he could go back to October – a stress fracture of the right elbow has ruled out Archer for at least three months – Silverwood said there was nothing he would change.', '“Not really. It’s just a case of: his injury occurred. The first scan didn’t show us where it was. The second has. We can now put a plan in place and get him going for our summer.”', '“Being a fast bowler is hard work. It is hard work. Ask Jimmy, ask Broad, ask any of them. Being a fast bowler is hard work. It’s just how it is.”', 'Some outside the England camp have suggested the degree of hard work – Archer bowled more overs than any other England player in 2019 – was simply too much for someone in his first season of international cricket. Silverwood remains unconvinced.', '“We’ll never know, will we? We can’t turn the clock back, all we can do is look to the future and say, well, ‘How are we going to do it from now on?’”', 'Silverwood’s plan involves the exciting prospect of a closely managed group of Test fast bowlers, with an Australia-style rotation policy to keep them fresh.', '“My dream, my ideal is to have three fast bowlers fit at any given point so we can rotate them, so they’re not always playing, and at any given point I’ve got one sat with his feet up full of energy waiting to go. So when he comes in he can go and hit the game hard, and just keep that going. That is the dream. We have to make it reality.”', 'As it stands, Archer, Wood and Olly Stone are already part of Silverwood’s planning for the next Ashes series in Australia.', '“I would love to have those for the Ashes because we all know we get judged on the Ashes, so how can we give ourselves the best chance of succeeding? If I have three of them fit there, whether it is those three or not, then it would be a great advantage for us.', '“I am excited to see Jofra and Wood in the same team. As an ex-fast bowler that would be exciting. But you have to get the right conditions to do that.”', 'Silverwood was speaking before England’s flight to East London for the start of the three-match T20 leg of their South Africa tour. It is a series England will be going all-out to win as part of their preparation for the T20 World Cup, a slight change of emphasis from the experimental lineups of the ODIs. Silverwood also spoke of his own commitment to carrying on the high-throttle style of England’s white-ball cricket in the Morgan-Bayliss era.', '“We’re going to keep being aggressive. That’s how we’re going to break records and this team can break records. We’ve seen it time and time again. They play exciting cricket. I love watching it, they love playing it and it’s been a successful formula for them.

Others might question the basic process of lumping India and Sri Lanka together as one cricketing landscape, given they remain separate nations with separate lineups and separate conditions.', 'For Jennings Sri Lanka presents an opportunity to push his case for selection not just as a South Asian specialist but across all conditions. “ I wouldn’t speculate about Test matches in six months’ time,” said Ed Smith, England’s national selector. “However, I would say that Keaton’s recall fits with what we need in this circumstance which is top-order depth with experience of playing in those conditions.”', 'As it stands, with Rory Burns missing the tour because of an ankle injury, Jennings, Dominic Sibley, Zak Crawley and Joe Denly will compete for three top-order batting spots, with Denly’s part-time leg-spin thrown in the hat as an extra bargaining chip.', 'Bairstow’s omission is consistent with his status as squad player in need of a rest after playing in all formats recently. Smith spoke of Bairstow simply needing to take his chances when they come in red-ball cricket.', '“There is a general understanding that players who are extremely busy in the IPL and international calendar, they don’t always get much chance to play domestic or even tour first-class matches.', '“However, the best plan for Jonny is to perform at a very high level whenever those opportunities come along. Opportunities for him in South Africa were scarce – he just got one Test match – but obviously if he can grab those opportunities when they come around, that is his best way forward.”', 'Jos Buttler retains his place despite averaging 21 in the last 12 months and passing 50 once in 19 innings. The selection of Foakes covers a situation where England might prefer a high-class specialist wicket-keeper. Buttler has at times been a porous presence standing up to the stumps against spin. Foakes made his Test debut in Galle in November 2018 and scored a first innings century', 'The strong suggestion from England is that Buttler remains first choice, with a great deal of emphasis placed on “continuity”. “He is a very talented player and he’s very highly regarded inside the team,” said Smith. “I think there is a lot of support for Jos’s talent.”', 'Joe Root (Yorkshire, capt), Dom Bess (Somerset), Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Zak Crawley (Kent), Sam Curran (Surrey), Joe Denly (Kent), Ben Foakes (Surrey), Keaton Jennings (Lancashire), Jack Leach (Somerset), Matthew Parkinson (Lancashire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Dominic Sibley (Warwickshire), Ben Stokes (Durham, vice-capt), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire), Mark Wood (Durham)', 'The fast bowling is in the hands of Mark Wood, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Sam Curran. Given England’s stated policy of rotating their fast bowlers there is a possibility Broad and Wood might play one game apiece. Woakes and Curran would look to be contesting one spot.', 'England will have three spin bowlers of diverse methods on tour: Jack Leach, Dominic Bess and Matthew Parkinson. The fact none of these spinners is centrally contracted is indicative of the open nature of selection. Adil Rashid has very strongly ruled himself out of contention. Moeen is still not mentally ready to resume full-time red ball cricket.', 'The two-match series offers the chance to pick up points in the World Test Championship, so England will be keen to start well, something that has been an issue on recent overseas tours.

Morelos’s representatives, World in Motion, did not comment when approached by the Guardian.

However, when the Mets move north to New York for the regular season the team’s minor league outfit, the St Lucie Mets, will not be allowed to use the new clubhouse, instead using older, more basic facilities elsewhere in the building.

  ["Why Premier League clubs are turning to an Australian bank in big numbers","['Teams in England’s top two divisions are taking sizeable loans from Macquarie, at times mortgaged against future TV earnings']","['It was once dubbed the “vampire kangaroo” and accused of “feasting on Britain’s creaking infrastructure” after investing in companies such as Thames Water and avoiding tax through a legal but controversial web of subsidiaries in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. But Macquarie Group Limited is a growing influence on English football, underlined on one day last month by Leicester and Wolves extending sizeable loans with the Australian investment bank that are mortgaged against future TV earnings.', 'Now with a portfolio that also includes Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Southampton, Swansea City, Watford, West Brom and Wolves, a company estimated to manage almost £288bn worth of assets has emerged as the second-biggest lender, behind Barclays bank, in an industry where owners continue to chase the dream. Since 2013, and encouraged by increased transparency in the game following the introduction of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations, Macquarie estimates that it has completed more than $1.5bn in loans across Europe’s major leagues, specialising in “transfer financing” and “media and sponsorship rights monetisation”.', 'Any club that uses such a facility must register a charge – security against the loan – with Companies House. The latest arrangement with Wolves, registered on 13 January, extends their £50m lending facility until March 2021.', 'That means part of the credits of future TV income – worth £130m a season under the latest deal – have been transferred to Macquarie in exchange for their capital, although it is not known how much interest Wolves will pay to receive the money in advance.', 'The latest charge registered by Leicester was also added on 13 January. But rather than being evidence of more borrowing, this was because the arrangement has to be ratified every six months by the Premier League, which distributes TV rights from its central fund.', '“Every time [a club] renew, effectively they are extending the length of the overdraft and it means that Macquarie are entitled to the money from the next tranche of TV money from the Premier League,” explains Kieran Maguire, who is a senior teacher at the University of Liverpool’s Management School and specialises in football finance. “There’s an awful lot of clubs doing this and it makes a lot of sense. The broadcasting payments are made three or four times a year but you’ve got all of the overheads going out in between, including the wage bill.', '“I understand that a lot of banks are providing similar services but, because they are not formally registering a charge, we don’t see the documentation because nothing is going through Companies House. It’s a risk in the same way that if you take out a mortgage and it helps from a cash flow point of view.”', 'Leicester’s relationship with Macquarie began in October 2018, three months after Riyad Mahrez joined Manchester City for £60m. As is common in most modern transfers, Pep Guardiola’s side were due to pay in instalments, with the final £36m due in two tranches by the end of July this year. Enter Macquarie. In exchange for the £36m, Leicester agreed a secured borrowing facility that means the transfer fee will be paid to Macquarie instead.', 'A similar service is provided by XXIII Capital, the company which has financed several multimillion transfer deals including Antoine Griezmann’s €120m move to Barcelona and that of his replacement at Atlético Madrid, João Félix.', 'Known in the business as “transfer factoring”, it has become an increasingly popular way of raising finance quickly to enable clubs to compete in the transfer market and deal with spiralling wage bills. But with interest rates estimated to be at least 6%-7%, the risks are clear.', 'Leicester’s latest loan does not specify how much they can borrow from Macquarie, although it is the sixth time they have entered an arrangement with the lender.', 'The second – made in December 2018 – has been satisfied but was reported at the time to be larger than the first arrangement over Mahrez and had been earmarked to help fund a new training ground and expand the King Power Stadium.', 'Two more are outstanding, although Maguire does not believe there is any evidence of financial difficulties at a club on course to qualify for the Champions League.', '“What will often happen is that you might have separate charge arrangements over separate assets belonging to the club,” he says. “It could be something as simple as that – I don’t think there is anything Machiavellian in it.”', 'Macquarie says it is selective about who it does business with. It has been marketing its services directly to English clubs and many have jumped at the opportunity to improve their cash flow.', 'Southampton, who previously borrowed money from the mysterious Vibrac Corporation that came under scrutiny from MPs in 2016, have a long-established relationship, having first taken out a loan in November 2016 secured against future TV rights. They have since returned annually and filed a new charge in the summer.', 'Meanwhile, Macquarie purchased half of the credits owed to Crystal Palace from the £45m transfer of Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United last summer. Courtesy of the bank, Bournemouth received the £12m then owed by Aston Villa for the England defender Tyrone Mings 12 months earlier than scheduled. Even Craig Dawson’s £5.5m move to Watford in the summer led West Brom to take out a £2,395,300 loan, corresponding to the amount of the fee they were due to be paid in June 2021.', 'Swansea’s first loan with Macquarie after they sold the Spanish midfielder Roque Mesa in June 2018 was satisfied last week, although the Championship club have two outstanding arrangements made almost 18 months ago. High-interest repayments from what Maguire describes as “boutique lenders” have become a feature of the multibillion-pound industry that is modern football but he does not think it necessarily spells trouble.', '“Any form of borrowing comes with an element of risk,” he says. “But fans might also take the view that if the club borrows and invests that on the pitch with players then that is likely to reduce the risk of relegation, therefore assuring the club of another year’s TV money. It’s a double-edged sword.', '“In an ideal world I think most fans would prefer that the club owner takes on the form of a benevolent dictator and gifts the club the money through an interest-free loan, like Farhad Moshiri has done at Everton. But they are always much harder to find.”']","Premier League","Sport","2020-02-11",15.3,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f628ecd19bd36de2cf0439fd4146726bad4eb13c/68_0_4121_2474/master/4121.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=51a011acb61918090c2e13a24a161d94","Leicester and Wolves extended loans with Macquarie on the same day in January.

  ["Gérard Houllier: the man who helped to make Liverpool great again","['The Frenchman had a profound impact on Liverpool and arguably deserves more adoration from the Anfield faithful']","['Radio is a terrible way to follow football. There will be those who disagree - they call themselves ‘purists’ - but commentary, even at its most vivid, without accompanying pictures leads to a fog of unclarity and uncertainty. Chances for the opposition team feel more threatening than they are whereas those for your own never seem to be anywhere near goal.', 'But sometimes radio is the only way to follow football, and sometimes it does provide the full picture. Like it did on the evening of Tuesday, 10 November 1998. I was 17 at the time, a Liverpool fanatic and alone in my bedroom listening to coverage of my team’s League Cup tie against Tottenham on a CD player that happened to have AM radio. The sound was fuzzy and the lack of visuals not ideal, but I got a sense of everything. Crucially, I felt it too. It felt like the end.', 'Liverpool came into the game on the back of three games without victory, two of which had been Premier League defeats. They were also playing poorly, as had been the case for some time, and the supporters, so proud of their loyalty and sense of strength in adversity, were starting to give up. There was a crowd of just 20,772 at Anfield that night and they were the unlucky ones as Liverpool went on to lose 3-1. It was a pitiful performance played out in eerie, desperate silence.', 'And it really was the end - the end of Roy Evans’ and Gérard Houllier’s joint managership. It had started that summer after Evans had been the sole manager for the previous four years and 10 months. He had done a good job, returning a sense of pride and pizzazz to the club after Graeme Souness’ troubled spell in charge. Homegrown players such as Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman peaked having been given their wings by a man steeped in Liverpool’s boot room tradition and the team won things. Well, one thing - the 1995 League Cup.', 'They also challenged for the title but, ultimately, that was Evans’ downfall; Liverpool came close but never close enough and by the end of his reign were slipping backwards in that pursuit. A once-mighty institution was sinking into an abyss of mid-table and trophy-starved mediocrity and, as such, change was required. That meant Houllier coming in, initially to work alongside Evans. But it didn’t work and after the loss to Spurs, the latter departed.', 'Houllier’s first match as sole manager came that Saturday and once again it ended in a 3-1 home defeat, this time to Leeds. Anfield was full on this occasion and those in attendance could have been forgiven for thinking nothing was ever going to change. But it would. For in the dugout there was a Frenchman with a revolutionary spirit and he would save Liverpool Football Club.', 'That may sound like a wild overstatement but the evidence is pretty clear. Across Houllier’s five full seasons in charge, Liverpool won five major pieces of silverware, with three of those forming the remarkable treble of 2000-01, a campaign in which the club also returned to Europe’s elite competition, the Champions League, for the first time in a generation. The following year there was also a second-place finish resulting from a final tally of 80 points, Liverpool’s highest during the Premier League era and enough to have won a 19th league championship in four of the previous five campaigns.', 'Liverpool were a force again, at home and abroad, and while ultimately Houllier’s time at the club ended with no league title and, as most managerial reigns do, messily and regretfully, his impact was profound, on and off the pitch. The Frenchman not only got Liverpool winning again but he did so with a squad that through practice and mental fortitude had finally entered the modern era. More than that, he brought through a core of players who long after his departure would continue to thrive.', 'Some would call it a legacy, and one of real poignancy given Houllier almost died making Liverpool great again. The story is well known but bears repeating: at half-time of a league fixture with Leeds in October 2001, Liverpool’s manager suffered a dissected aorta that required him to undergo an emergency bypass operation lasting over 11 hours. He wouldn’t have made it had it not been for a series of fortunate circumstances and, arguably, things would not have unravelled so fast and drastically had Houllier not returned to work so soon, which he did through a sense of duty, drive and passion.', 'That is the other beguiling aspect of the story - managing Liverpool was not a cold assignment for him but rather a calling dating back to the late 1960s when he moved to the city in order to work as a teaching assistant at Alsop Comprehensive, a former grammar school located less than a couple of miles away from Anfield. Houllier fell in love with his surroundings and, a football fanatic for as long as he could remember, it was no surprise he found himself drawn to the local team that played in red. Bill Shankly’s Liverpool were on the march and Houllier breathed in their fire, no more so than on the night he stood on the Kop and watched the hosts dismantle Dundalk 10-0 in a Uefa Cup tie.', 'Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3', 'He eventually returned to France where teaching morphed into a hugely successful coaching career that peaked with the Ligue 1 title he won with Paris Saint-Germain in 1986. Come the summer of 1997, he was being asked by Peter Robinson, Liverpool’s chief executive, if he would like to return to the city, this time to manage the club he once watched and still adored.', 'Houllier turned down the invitation as he was in the midst of overseeing France’s pursuit of the 1998 World Cup in his role as technical director with the French Football Federation, but with that triumph achieved and his contract with the FFF having expired, he decided the time was right to take on the job of his dreams, doing so on the basis that Evans remained. It was a curious state of affairs - Liverpool’s first foreign boss working as a joint manager with somebody who had already been in the post for some time. Both insisted it could work; both probably knew deep down that it wouldn’t.', 'Clear lines of communication was an issue - the players didn’t know who to speak to and who, actually, was in charge. Their approach was an issue, too. Evans was old-school, trusting his players to largely regulate their own diet and fitness, which meant even in the 1990s, a period when English football was going through profound change, there were players at the country’s most successful club eating beans and sausage on toast as a pre-match meal and skipping sessions in the gym if they felt like it. The ‘Spice Boys’ tag may have been overplayed but it also struck at a truth.', 'Indeed, this is why Houllier was brought into Liverpool in the first place. Robinson recognised his coaching credentials but also his ability to instil discipline and a greater level of professionalism in regards to how the club operated. The hope was that could be achieved with Evans, a hugely popular and loyal servant for over 35 years, sharing the managerial hot seat. But ultimately a clean break was required. “It would be easy to stay, but to give Gérard and his team a chance you have to walk away,” said a teary Evans at the press conference held to announce his departure. “I didn’t want to end as a ghost on the wall.”', 'Houllier’s style was as different to Evans’ as ballet is to jazz but that did not mean him kicking the door down at Liverpool’s Melwood training base on day one of becoming sole manager and demanding everyone did 20 push-ups on the spot. A former schoolteacher who knew how to impose himself on a group of young men, Houllier may have wanted to do that, but he recognised that making sweeping changes could significantly harm his authority in the way it had done Souness at the start of the decade. So instead he went about things gradually. There was no French revolution.', 'Having brought in former club captain Phil Thompson to be his assistant, Houllier essentially used the remainder of the 1998-99 season as a recce, observing what was working and, more importantly, what needed to change. That eventually led to overhauls in nutrition and fitness, training sessions becoming more focused on tactics and defending and, most profoundly, a sweep of the squad.', 'The end of that campaign, one in which Liverpool finished seventh and a yawning 25 points behind champions Manchester United, saw a host of players leave, most notably captain Paul Ince. In author Simon Hughes’ book Ring of Fire, Houllier insists he liked Ince and recognised he was a “fantastic player”, but through those initial observations he also recognised that the self-styled ‘Guv’nor’ was an overbearing presence in the dressing room and the organiser of one too many nights out. Quite simply Ince had to go, and he did, joining Middlesbrough for £1m in July 1999. Other established figures were also sold, including David James, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Bjørn Tore Kvarme, while McManaman left on a free transfer having signed a contract with Real Madrid the previous January. His exit, unlike the others, was a blow but it was a further sign that Liverpool were moving on.', 'It was at this point that Houllier displayed one of the assets that made him such an impactful, successful manager: recruitment. It’s one thing getting rid of bad players, it’s another signing the right ones to replace them, but that is what Houllier did ahead of his first full season in charge. By and large, the names were unknown and underwhelming - Sami Hyypiä, Stéphane Henchoz, Titi Camara, Erik Meijer, Sander Westerveld, Dietmar Hamann - but they embodied exactly what the manager wanted. As Houllier puts it in Ring of Fire, “We signed a group of players from different countries, different leagues and different attitudes - probably more in tune with what happened elsewhere. Sometimes you need to change and evolve.”', 'That is certainly what Liverpool did. Not long into the new season, it was obvious this was a very different side to that which had performed under Evans - less adventurous but also less flaky, operating with a level of organisation, doggedness and steel that had been absent for most of the previous decade. Hyypiä and Henchoz were crucial to that, forming a superb centre-back partnership that was well protected by Hamann, who, having overcome an injury in the opening-day victory over Sheffield Wednesday, developed into one of the most impressive defensive midfielders in the country.', 'It may not have been pretty but it was effective and inside 12 months Liverpool jumped from seventh to fourth on the back of the best defence in the land, conceding just 30 goals in 38 fixtures. They missed out on Champions League qualification by two points following a final day defeat to Bradford but, overall, it had been a positive campaign, in part because, alongside the contributions of the initially-mysterious foreign imports, there were those from a core of homegrown talent.', 'This touches on one of the great myths of Houllier’s time at Liverpool - that he stripped the club of its English heart. The truth is that there were not many other managers, before or after the Frenchman, who gave more players from this country a chance. David Thompson, Dominic Matteo, Danny Murphy and Jamie Redknapp all featured during the 1999-2000 season, as did Michael Owen, having by that stage cemented his status as the hot thing of English football. And then there was Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard who in different ways are testimony to Houllier’s belief that one of his main responsibilities as Liverpool manager was to help the club’s young players progress.', 'Given his debut by Evans in 1997, Carragher was a hard-working but limited player whose somewhat reckless off-field nature put him in danger of wasting a career before it had properly started. Few would have blamed Houllier if he turned his back on the Bootle-born star, but instead he took the time to get to know Carragher, recognising that he was a youth team graduate who maintained a wild side but was also willing to listen and improve. “Jamie was clever in reading the game and learning from his experiences, both good and bad,” Houllier says in Ring of Fire. “He was patient with himself and patient with me and I explained to him from the beginning that I saw him as a player who would find himself.”', 'That is what Carragher did, getting his head down in 1999-2000 as a versatile centre-back or full-back option, going onto have a Liverpool career that spanned 17 years and over 700 appearances for the club. ‘Carra’ became a bona fide Anfield legend. ', 'The situation with Gerrard was more straightforward in that it was obvious to Houllier as soon as he saw the midfielder play in a youth game against Blackburn that he had the talent and desire to make it at the top level. The issue instead was growing pains - Gerrard’s teenage frame struggled with the demands of men’s football, leading to him collecting numerous injuries having made his debut for the first team, again against Blackburn, on 29 November 1998. Patience more than guidance was required and that is what Houllier showed, even sending Gerrard to France to be treated by a team of physiotherapists with the firm belief that, long term, it would lead to this most precocious of talents being able to put a string of games together. He did, and then some.', 'Not all of the homegrown players progressed under Houllier, with Thompson and Matteo not even getting past that first season. They were sold to Coventry and Leeds respectively in the summer of 2000 as Houllier went on another transfer splurge, bringing in the likes of Markus Babbel and Gary McAllister to add guile and experience to a squad that showed itself to be short of those qualities in the final few weeks of the previous campaign. Again, Houllier’s sense of what was required in recruitment proved spot-on as Liverpool enjoyed their most successful season from a trophy-winning point of view since 1983-84.', 'The treble was the undeniable high point of Houllier’s time at Liverpool, and while the team were fortunate to win the FA Cup final - when Owen single-handedly turned a game that had been well and truly going Arsenal’s way - they showed incredible resilience and quality throughout a long and gruelling campaign. It was also one littered with memorable results – home and away wins against Manchester United and Everton as well as a Uefa Cup semi-final victory over Barcelona that included a masterful goalless draw at Camp Nou in the first leg. It was a game which, more than any other, showed how mature and tactically astute Liverpool had become under Houllier. How they were finally back to being a ‘proper’ team.', 'Everything was set up for Liverpool to push on and that is what they did in the 2001-02 season, finishing above Manchester United for the first time in the Premier League era and only missing out on the title to an Arsenal side that went on to land a second double in four years. But that campaign was ultimately the beginning of the end, in part because of what happened to the man in the charge on what should have been a relatively straightforward autumn afternoon.', 'Houllier was rushed to hospital at half-time of the Leeds game with chest pains. He initially thought it was down to flu and was keen to get out for the second half, especially given Liverpool were trailing 1-0. But having taken his blood pressure, Mark Waller, the club doctor, insisted he went to hospital and, as Houllier outlines in Ring of Fire, the timing proved critical. “At full time there was unbelievable traffic around Anfield and the ambulance would not have got through. At half-time, this was not the case. I was very lucky.”', 'There followed more luck: the hospital Houllier was taken to, Broadgreen, was just one of three cardio specialist units in the country, and the surgeon who operated on him was meant to be away but had decided to stay in Liverpool because he was feeling tired.', 'Houllier’s operation was a success but it meant him being signed off from work for an entire year. Thompson took charge of the team in his absence and did a fine job, maintaining Liverpool’s upward momentum in the league and Champions League. He could well have carried on until May but such was Houllier’s desire to get back to work that he returned to the dugout inside five months, appearing, unannounced, ahead of the visit of Roma in March 2002. It was an uplifting moment that sent Anfield into rapture, but it was shocking to see just how frail Houllier had become. This once straight-backed and imposing presence was now gaunt and hollow-eyed. He was a reduced man and, as events would prove, a reduced manager.', 'The biggest failing came in the area Houllier had been so strong - recruitment. The Frenchman’s judgement appeared to have deserted him, leading to a string of signings in the summer of 2002 that derailed Liverpool’s attempts to improve on their runners-up place from the previous campaign. El Hadji-Diouf, Salif Diao and Bruno Cheyrou … names to make all Liverpool fans shudder.', 'Tactically the team also lost its way. The solidity in defence evaporated while in midfield and attack Liverpool became stodgy, ragged and largely ineffective. It culminated in a collapse from second in 2001-02 to fifth and outside of the Champions League places in 2002-03. And while a fourth-place finish and subsequent return to Europe’s top table was achieved the following campaign, it was not enough to save Houllier, especially given Liverpool finished 30 points behind Arsenal.', 'Houllier insists the effects of his heart scare have been overplayed, claiming it was down to genetics rather than stress, and rather than impair his judgement it hampered his ability to do his job on a practical level. For instance, he had to rest more at home after surgery, which in turn meant fewer overseas trips to scout players, which in turn meant making signings based on trust rather than due diligence, which in turn led to the likes of Diouf, Diao and Cheyrou arriving at Anfield. That may be true but, as the cliché goes, football is a results business and by the end the results were simply not good enough, at home or abroad, with Liverpool exiting the 2002-03 Champions League at the group stages after a tepid 3-3 draw with Swiss side Basel. The manager also appeared to be feeling the strain, lashing out at outside criticism and justifying his methods in the flimsiest of manners.', 'His departure was inevitable and ushered in a new era: the Rafa Benítez era. Soon Liverpool fans would be celebrating the miracle of Istanbul and a catalogue of other glorious European occasions. Juventus, Chelsea, Barcelona, Inter, Real Madrid. Stories to tell the grandchildren.', 'Benítez is rightly revered by Liverpool fans for what he achieved during his six years at the club, but that also begs the question why Houllier is not held in the same esteem for what he did during his time on Merseyside. For while the Frenchman, now aged 72 and having not managed since a stint at Aston Villa in 2010-11, will never have to buy a pint around Anfield, the lack of love for him in those parts is glaring. His name is rarely mentioned let alone sung, while his face is not visible anywhere among the kaleidoscope of banners and flags that adorn the Kop.', 'In part, that may be because he never won either of the trophies that really matter to Kopites – the league or European Cup – and also perhaps because of the way it ended. It may even have something to do with Houllier’s relationship with Fowler, which deteriorated to the point that a player known as ‘God’ among the fans felt he had no option but to leave and join Leeds in November 2001. Regardless, almost 16 years since Houllier himself left Liverpool, there is no denying his achievements while in charge of the club are worthy of great appreciation.', 'It really cannot be overestimated how great the sense of drift was at Liverpool in the late 1990s, caught perfectly in that bleak night at a half-empty Anfield in November 1998, resulting from the decay that often sets in at mighty clubs in their post-imperial years. Houllier reversed the tide through his intelligence, instincts and talent, and what was ultimately important to him was not just what he won but what he left behind. Gerrard, for one, is grateful for having Gérard Houllier around during his formative years at Liverpool, describing him as a “father figure”.', '“The fans don’t truly appreciate what Gérard did for the club,” says Thompson. “He worked tirelessly, rebuilding the team. Above all, it shouldn’t be forgotten that he nearly gave his life to make Liverpool great again.”', 'This article was first published by These Football Times as part of their special Liverpool edition.']","Liverpool","Sport","2020-02-11",13,"Tue","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262372f9d838a013b599d905df7deb550bd64adb/0_21_1133_680/master/1133.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=798aa8a5b56b25a79ccbba5a5b59e6ae","Gérard Houllier did not win a league title at Liverpool but he belatedly dragged the club into the modern era.

  ["Uefa hopes Disney magic can help inspire more young girls into football","['Head of women’s football Nadine Kessler says grassroots initiative Playmakers can empower youngsters, with an assist from The Incredibles’ Elastigirl']","['Uefa has today launched a radical European-wide grassroots initiative, called Playmakers, targeting girls aged five to eight in line with the ruling body of the European game’s aim to double participation in women’s and girl’s football across the continent by 2024. Uefa’s head of women’s football, Nadine Kessler, told the Guardian that the programme, which has been backed by Manchester United’s Nemanja Matic and Scotland’s Erin Cuthbert, two of the countries involved in the initial rollout, shows a commitment to the game from top to bottom.', 'Kessler, who won the Women’s Euro with Germany in 2013 and Fifa’s world player of the year in 2014, added: “The growth over the last five years has been significant. We’ve really worked hard not just to get a strategic plan in place but one that is going to be action-led hence the name: Time for Action.', '“The changes to the Women’s Champions League format, the centralisation of rights and now Playmakers at the grassroots level are one after the other being rolled out and underline that we are committed and serious and willing to do our bit to build the women’s game as much as possible.”', 'The Playmakers programme has been developed following extensive research carried out by Leeds Beckett University, on behalf of Europe’s governing body. The university studied what motivates young girls’ participation in sport and looked to identify the best coaching practices. It concluded that there were many positive benefits to play-based education. It also established a knowledge transfer partnership with the Football Association.', '“We have devised a programme that offers a different route, a different choice. Something that is for girls who are completely new to football,” Kessler said. “We always target those ones that are a little bit interested but we are also targeting those that don’t have any interest in sport or football at all. We are really trying to capture a whole new generation of girls.”', 'Like the FA’s Shooting Stars programme, Playmakers is being run in partnership with Disney. When the FA announced the link-up there was criticism of the idea that girls should aspire to be like Disney princesses. Kessler, though, believes that is short-sighted and says the company can both help reach parents and enhance girls’ play using a story-based methodology.', 'Kessler said: “This is actually more about empowering females and little girls, allowing them to make decisions, embracing differences and providing an environment where they can be creative and have a lot of choice, instead of just providing the traditional pathway. This programme is all about female empowerment and how healthy they can be doing sport. The message is that football is fun – just express yourself, try it out, explore it.', '“If you look at The Incredibles 2 [which the initial 10 sessions will be based upon] Elastigirl is a woman who saves the world and is a mum. We’ll pick stories, films and characters that aren’t the stereotypical princess-like stories.”', 'Seven countries are involved in the initial rollout of the programme, beginning with Belgium in March, with the aim of being in every European country by the end of 2021.', '“We really had a close look at where to roll out the programme first. The seven pilot countries were a) countries that were super-motivated in implementing the programme, and b) because we have different countries from different regions it will help us draw the right conclusions from our pilot, work out the scale of the project and ensure the quality of the delivery, which is the most pivotal part of what we’re doing.”', 'Delivering the programme in countries where the development and acceptance of women’s football ranges widely will be a test, Kessler said: “The situation in each country is unique and needs to be approached in a unique way. I really hope it will give more proof to encourage more girls but also send the message that football is a sport for girls and women. How we promote and communicate and market Playmakers will be essential in how much we are able to change and challenge perceptions.”', 'With the FA having admitted that it has lacked the coaches to fully capitalise on the interest following the Women’s World Cup last summer, could Uefa struggle similarly? Kessler believes not. “Our coaches will follow our coaching methodology strictly, we have coach educators that will train the coaches on the ground and are the most decisive factor in the delivery of the programme,” she said. “We see that the interest is there but we have to keep working to find more talent. We don’t see that as a stumbling block at the moment but it’s certainly an area we need to focus on.”', 'Being flexible in their approach is also important. “Playmakers will not necessarily be rolled out through federations,” Kessler said. “It can be through clubs or regions. We want to have a programme that is flexible, that goes where the girls are and helps them to have a choice that they’ve not had before.”']","Women's football","Sport","2020-02-13",8,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b5468c86e663fa855dabb6e51c3d07cf421c37/123_84_1659_996/master/1659.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=6b8d52a1b578364cffc16bedc50b1754","Uefa’s Playmakers is aimed at increasing girls’ interest in football among the five-to-eight age group.

  ["Scott Parker unhappy with Millwall equaliser as Fulham are frustrated","['Fulham left the Den with a point, but Scott Parker was unhappy after Jon Dadi Bodvarsson’s goal was allowed to stand. “It was clear as day that they had two players offside,” Parker said afterwards. “Who [the pass] comes off is perhaps in question, but anyone would think it’s a little bit unjust to think that a goal was given when there’s clearly an advantage from two of their players standing in an offside position.”']","['Bodvarsson’s seventh-minute goal cancelled out Aleksandar Mitrovic’s third-minute opener, and Jed Wallace blazed a penalty over the bar for Millwall before the interval. “I think our reaction after the goal was pretty poor, and in the first half we turned the game into what Millwall wanted it to be,” Parker added.', '“In the second half we got a grip on the game. We stamped our mark on it, which I asked for at half-time because we needed to be braver. The pitch and the conditions were tough to deal with, but that’s the way I want my team to play - we have to take the sting out of the game. Overall I think we’re happy with a point, and we’re six games unbeaten now.”', 'It could have been three but Neeskens Kebano hit the crossbar with a header in injury time which would have taken them into second place. The draw puts Fulham back level with second-placed Leeds but out of the automatic promotion places on goal difference, while Millwall are now seven points off the play-off pace.', 'Alex Neil’s first visit to the Bet365 Stadium since spurning Stoke’s advances earlier in the season proved to be a positive one as his Preston side closed the gap on the automatic places to three points with a 2-0 win. Stoke were dominant for the first hour but North End went ahead with their first shot on target, after 58 minutes, when a corner ricocheted off Ben Davies and Alan Browne reacted fastest to poke home from inside the six-yard box. And Tom Barkhuizen doubled their lead 15 minutes from time, with Davies nodding down Paul Gallagher’s cross for the former Morecambe forward to stroke home.', '““We showed different strengths from what we normally do. We showed great resolve, great grit and did the basics really well. That was certainly one of our poorest performances in quite a while but we got the job done,” Neil said. “We’re three points off second – we just need to get across the line. It wasn’t pretty – nobody’s talking about this game in a week’s time.”', 'Bristol City kept up the pressure on Preston and the playoff places with a 3-2 win over Derby, who scored their goals through Martyn Waghorn and Chris Martin in the last half‑hour and made for a nervous finish at Ashton Gate. The hosts took a 38th-minute lead when Niclas Eliasson’s deep cross from the right was volleyed back across goal by Jay Dasilva for Nakhi Wells to mark his first start for the club with a powerful header. It was 2-0 just before the interval as Derby were again found wanting in the air. Famara Diedhiou’s header from a corner was blocked, but Filip Benkovic pounced to nod home.', 'The Rams did not learn their lesson either, and Ashley Williams headed down another Eliasson cross for Diedhiou to volley home a third after 58 minutes. Three minutes later Waghorn dived to head home and spark a spell of intense pressure.Luton lifted themselves off the bottom with a 1-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday, James Collins scoring in the 23rd minute to take his side to within seven points of safety and condemn the Owls to their sixth defeat in nine league games.', 'Cardiff won 3-0 at relegation-threatened Huddersfield, first-half goals from Josh Murphy and Will Vaulks doing the bulk of the damage as the Bluebirds climbed two places to maintain their push for a play-off place. And Callum Paterson bagged a 69th-minute third to put the contest out of reach as City extended their impressive league run to just one defeat from their last 11 matches.', '“We’re on a good run of form,” said their manager, Neil Harris. “We’re getting into a nice position but you have to keep doing it at this level.

That could put further financial pressure on UK Athletics, whose reserves have dropped from more than £4.5m in 2016 to £2.8m last year.', 'Sources fear the BBC holds all the bargaining chips in the negotiations because UK Athletics has been rocked by a series of crises and poor performances, and is now the subject of an unprecedented UK Sport review.', 'While the current BBC deal, agreed in 2013, was the result of lengthy but fruitful talks, it is understood that nowhere near as much progress has been made this time round.', 'UK Athletics’ bargaining position has not been helped by the absence of a chief executive for the past 17 months after Niels de Vos, who negotiated the current deal, moved on. However sources say the organisation was slow to act – much to the surprise of the BBC, which not only pays UK Athletics £3m in rights fees but also, unusually, pays its own production costs.', 'Apart from brief spells with ITV and Channel 4 in the 80s and 90s, the BBC has been UK Athletics’ main broadcast partner for the past four decades. However a spokesperson for the sport left open the possibility that this might change.', 'While insisting UK Athletics had made “good progress in our discussions with a number of potential broadcast partners including the BBC”, the spokesperson told the Guardian major events do “not need to be exclusive to one provider and this is where more options are becoming available to us with the best levels of financial return”.', 'The organisation also believes that World Athletics’ new 10-year deal with the Chinese broadcaster Wanda will help boost its finances.', 'Meanwhile Frank Dick, the British Athletics director of coaching between 1979 and 1994, during the golden age of the sport, has told the Guardian he believes UK Sport has received “a pretty shoddy return on investment” from UKA since lottery funding began in 1997.', 'UK Athletics has been given more than £110m to fund elite athletics over the past 23 years but Dick, who also guided Daley Thompson to successive Olympic decathlon gold medals in 1980 and 1984 and recently worked with the England rugby team, said track and field had not capitalised on that support because of a lack of leadership and a series of poor decisions.', '“There has to be a strong strategic vision, over a four-year Olympic cycle, and I don’t think there is one,” said Dick. “I have had the enormous privilege of working with Eddie Jones and when you sit down with these guys, they almost know what they want to do every day between now and 21 October 2023, when the Rugby World Cup final takes place. It is a four-year process. Too often athletics thinks in the short term.”', 'Dick also cited neglect of grassroots coaching as being another significant factor in Britain failing to hit its medal target at last year’s world championships in Doha – and said the fact that so many top athletes, including Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Andy Pozzi, Matthew Hudson-Smith and Adam Gemili go abroad to train speaks volumes.', '“There has been a serious malaise in how they look after the coaches,” he said. “I honestly believe that we have world-class coaches and athletes out there. But for these people to fulfil this potential they have to be given the right level of support.”', 'Dick, who joins two other UK Athletics performance directors, Malcolm Arnold and Max Jones, in being critical of the organisation in the past month, said the sport has to go back to basics. “You have to get the culture right, you have to get the processes right and you have to get the people right,” he added. “UK Athletics needs to drill into these three areas and produce the strategy not just for how we will get our medals in 2020 and 2024 but how we will sustain it in the future.”']","Athletics","Sport","2020-02-12",21,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0a798ee18fa8e49e2d536a8653dcf8c6ce1d233/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=fd3607dc30d8db5135cb0c462ed325b3","BBC pundits Michael Johnson and Jessica Ennis-Hill broadcast from the Diamond League in London in 2018, one of the elite events.

The club had appealed against the decision by the “investigatory chamber” (IC) of Uefa’s club financial control body to charge City with breaches of FFP, and refer the case to the control body’s “adjudicatory chamber” (AC). The IC’s investigation followed publication of internal City emails by the German magazine Der Spiegel which suggested the club had deceived Uefa in their financial submissions, principally because City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, was funding the club’s sponsorship by the state’s airline, Etihad.', 'City deny any wrongdoing and appealed to Cas against the referral by the IC itself, arguing that it was made “improperly and prematurely”, that it “lacked procedural fairness and due process”, and did not treat City equally with other European clubs.

  ["Virgil van Dijk was a Liverpool bargain at £75m. What would he cost now?","['Defender’s transformative effect outstrips that of De Bruyne, Hazard and others and he would improve any team in the world ']","['Speculative stories are beginning to emerge about Virgil van Dijk’s future, which is no real surprise since – to paraphrase Jane Austen – a 28-year-old defender with the world at his feet must be about to make someone a fortune.', 'In point of fact the Netherlands international would find it difficult to make a step up from Anfield right now, what with Liverpool poised to add the Premier League title to the Champions League crown they hold and may well successfully defend in the next few months.', 'There is no actual need for Van Dijk to go anywhere and quite possibly he won’t, especially if Liverpool are willing to practically double his money by offering an early contract extension, though suggestions that Pep Guardiola might be about to turn up at Juventus next season and wave a cheque for £150m under the Merseyside club’s nose are an amusing way of passing the time until the full fixture programme returns.', 'While that scenario sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the 18 Premier League clubs who would not mind seeing Liverpool and Manchester City hit by a double whammy, it is surely no accident that Van Dijk finds himself the centre of attention. Should the financial giants of Italy or Spain decide to launch an irresistible attack on Premier League talent, who else would they go for?', 'Van Dijk at the moment is probably the Premier League’s most marketable property, one of the very few players who might be worth £150m. It is only two years since eyebrows were raised when Liverpool shelled out £75m for a player who had been hiding in plain sight at Celtic and Southampton, though it was quickly acknowledged that far from going out on a limb Jürgen Klopp and his staff had got themselves a bargain. When one considers how good Liverpool have been since then, the standards that have been set, what has been achieved and the fact that the player is better for the experience and hitting his prime, it does not seem unreasonable for an already high price to have doubled.', 'The feeling with Van Dijk is that a player who can make a £75m price tag seem insignificant can probably do the same for twice the amount.', 'Van Dijk deservedly won the award for PFA player of the season last year, was predictably and somewhat unluckily pipped by Lionel Messi at the Ballon d’Or and – with Liverpool now champions of the world in addition to Europe and most likely England – he is bound to be in the running for all the individual gongs this season. To stand out in the present Liverpool lineup is some feat, especially for a defender, but Van Dijk might just be the most transformative signing made in recent seasons in English football.', 'Although Kevin De Bruyne stands out at Manchester City, he arrived when Manuel Pellegrini was in charge and had to wait a couple of seasons for success. Eden Hazard won European and domestic honours with Chelsea and was unquestionably a standout asset, though it is hard to transform a club that keep changing their managers. The same could be said of Manchester United, where to suggest big-money signings such as Ángel Di María, Romelu Lukaku, Paul Pogba and Alexis Sánchez have not really worked out would be an understatement. Harry Maguire is doing rather better, without providing the instant backbone Van Dijk brought to Liverpool. John Stones appears to be finding it difficult to live up to Guardiola’s expectations at City, and though Aymeric Laporte inspires more confidence his long-term injury this season has cost his club points.', 'Liverpool’s miserly defensive record over the past two seasons does not quite tell its own story, since Alisson arrived half a season after Van Dijk and the goalkeeper not only fixed a problem area but went on to prove a model of consistency. Statistics show Alisson has one of the best shot-stopping ratios around, though they also indicate he faces fewer shots per game than most Premier League goalkeepers.', 'However the credit is apportioned, Liverpool’s goals‑conceded column has become seriously impressive in the past two seasons, particularly for a club that sometimes had a habit of giving goals away cheaply. This season the defence has been breached 15 times in 25 games. For purposes of comparison, second-placed City have conceded 29 times, just over a goal a game, exactly the same as Manchester United. The meanest defence in the Premier League outside Anfield belongs to Sheffield United, with 24 goals against after 26 matches. Last season, though City were champions by a point, they conceded 23 goals to Liverpool’s 22 with Chelsea and Spurs joint next best on 39.', 'When Van Dijk arrived mid‑season Liverpool finished with 38 goals conceded, 10 more than José Mourinho’s Manchester United. The centre-half might not have improved Liverpool’s defensive efficiency all by himself – he obviously has teammates around him to help – though if you had to pick a one-man defence from the options available there is no doubt where most would look. Van Dijk plays with authority, plays every minute, and sets a tremendous example. He has been a wonderful signing, even at a record‑breaking price, and you don’t need to hire Guardiola to spot that. He is the player Liverpool fans would least like to see leave, precisely because he would not only walk into any team in the world but improve them.']","Liverpool","Sport","2020-02-12",19,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5637869d687364255b42fc77ff21157759643d90/0_44_2813_1687/master/2813.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a942165135fcdae2ac7a380c4f5ba8e5","Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk is at the moment probably the most marketable property in the Premier League.

  ["Spurs criticise OED over expanded definition of 'yid'","['North London club says entry referring to its fans’ use of term ‘fails to distinguish context’']","['Tottenham Hotspur have criticised the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) after it expanded its definition of the word “yid” to include a “supporter of or player for” the football club.', 'The word, typically used as an offensive epithet for Jewish people, has been adopted by some Spurs fans as a nickname. Use of the term among Jewish and non-Jewish supporters alike has been the subject of controversy in recent years but has been defended as an attempt to reclaim the term from its racist usage by opposing fans.', 'The OED, has included the word in its latest list of new and updated entries, along with the related term “yiddo”. It said that as well as their racist meanings the words could refer to “a supporter of or player for Tottenham Hotspur football club (traditionally associated with the Jewish community in north and east London).”', 'It said the words’ use was “originally and frequently derogatory and offensive, though also often as a self-designation.”', 'In response, Spurs told the Guardian: “As a club we have never accommodated the use of the Y-word on any club channels or in club stores and have always been clear that our fans (both Jewish and gentile) have never used the term with any intent to cause offence. We find the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of the word misleading given it fails to distinguish context, and welcome their clarification.”', 'The OED said it was bound to “reflect rather than dictate” how language is used, and noted that it had labelled the term as offensive and derogatory.', 'Some critics said the decision to add the definition could give legitimacy to use of a term that they viewed as unequivocally racist.', 'David Baddiel, the writer and comedian who has campaigned in the past against the chanting of the word yid and other antisemitic chants across a variety of football clubs, said the association that the OED had noted was mainly mythical.', '“The vast majority of fans of the club, including those who self-designate as Y-words, are not Jewish and therefore have no right of ‘reclamation’,” he said.', '“What it will weirdly give succour to is: when The Y-Word campaign first started, a Spurs fan said to me, a Jewish person who feels uncomfortable with that word: ‘Fuck off, it’s our word now.’ Can you imagine something similar with any other race hate word? Jews are not even allowed to own their own hate.”', 'Tottenham fans and other Jewish people offered differing views. Stephen Pollard, the editor of the Jewish Chronicle, tweeted: “Not controversial among many of the Jewish Spurs supporters, such as myself, who are proud to be Yiddos.”', 'Last year the north London club carried out a consultation with fans on their use of the Y-word and received more than 23,000 responses. It found that 33% of respondents used the Y-word “regularly” in a footballing context, while 18% who did not use the term in a footballing context considered it offensive, rising to 35% among Jewish respondents.', 'Almost half of all respondents said they would prefer to see supporters chant the Y-word less or stop using it altogether. The club, which has been organising focus groups to explore the issue further, said at the time that sentiment around the term appeared to be changing among the fanbase. “There is a recognition of the offence the Y-word can cause and that a footballing context alone does not justify its continued use,” it said.', 'Another Jewish Spurs fan, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian he was surprised at the number of Jewish fans coming out against use of the word. “When do I feel uncomfortable being Jewish at Spurs? When Chelsea and West Ham fans make gas chamber noises. Not when fans of the club that embraced Jewish immigrants chant a word rooted in that history,” he said.', 'The new OED entry on the word refers to mentions made in news reports dating back to 1972 and 1982 of antisemitic chants during clashes between rival football supporters.', 'The OED said it had chosen to cover this sense of the term now because it was revising and updating words from this part of the alphabet. ', '“As a historical dictionary, the Oxford English Dictionary records the usage and development of words in the English language,” a spokesperson said. “We reflect rather than dictate how language is used, which means we include words which may be considered sensitive and derogatory. These are always labelled as such.', '“The entry for ‘yiddo’ is labelled as offensive and derogatory and our reference to Tottenham Hotspur is a reflection of the evidence for the word. As we state at the closely related word ‘yid’, Tottenham Hotspur football club is traditionally associated with the Jewish community in north and east London, and the term is sometimes used as a self-designation by some Tottenham fans. We will ensure the context for this connection is very clear in both definitions.” ']","Tottenham Hotspur","Sport","2020-02-12",18.1,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6a104ede93ad537ebdbd1a73e375fb82312646/200_0_3608_2164/master/3608.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d9863b4584bc5ad78a486b9d5506fdfe","A Spurs banner at Wembley in 2015.

Her starting date is yet to be confirmed but she will join a sport that has lost two chairs, two chief executives and its performance director Neil Black in the last 17 months – and this week also became the subject of a major UK Sport review.', 'That review could well lead to job losses and a cut in lottery funding, and to make matters potentially worse UK Athletics will also soon announce the findings of a separate independent review into its relationship with the US coach Alberto Salazar, who received a four-year ban for doping last year.', 'There are also questions over the long-term state of the organisation’s finances, with the Guardian revealing on Wednesday that the BBC was willing to pay only a fraction of the £3m-a-year fee it currently pays the organisation for live coverage.', 'Adams will become the organisation’s first full-time chief executive since Niels de Vos left in 2018. The post was originally due to be filled by Zara Hyde Peters in December but she stepped down before starting after questions were raised over whether she allowed her husband to coach at a local athletics club after he had an “inappropriate relationship” with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.', 'Adams is credited with professionalising netball by bringing in major sponsors and television agreements while growing grassroots participation during her 10 years in the sport – which included hosting the most successful World Cup in the sport’s history in 2019.', 'After leaving England Netball last August she became the first chief commercial officer at the London Legacy Development Corporation, the organisation responsible for the regeneration of east London and delivering legacy after the London 2012 Olympics.', 'When Adams starts her new role there will be a game of musical chairs at UK Athletics with Clark – who took over from Richard Bowker last year – stepping down as chair to take on the development of a commercial plan for track and field. Nic Coward, who took over as acting chief executive only last month, will become chair for the rest of 2020.', '“The role of chair for UKA clearly now requires a huge time commitment during this crucial period,” said Clark, who was said by insiders to be surprised that a job that was supposed to take up five days a month was consuming far more of his time. “My other commitments to regulated businesses and public sector organisations have significantly increased since commencing the role and I have to concede that I cannot give it the time commitment it deserves right now.', '“However, I am delighted to have the opportunity to continue working with UK Athletics on the commercial strategy and Joanna’s appointment and her track record of success in not only sports governance but also commercial, marketing and competition structures means we have excellent leadership to take the sport in a positive future direction.”', 'Clark added: “Nic has already made a very positive impact and retaining his expertise for this transition period was an important consideration when the board debated the changes we needed to make. The focus now has to be the future and how we will apply the learnings and best practice from the ongoing reviews and ensure the sport has a hugely successful future.”']","Athletics","Sport","2020-02-14",0.59,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1a033c83134f6865fac0682e4c8c026dce61e6/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=77cab48b162671ec647fb1f8ab862aa1","Chris Clark said he does not have the time to be chairman of UK Athletics while Joanna Adams will be tasked with rebuilding the organisation’s battered reputation in her role as chief executive.

Both say they intend to stay at Saracens next season but do not yet know to what extent relegation to the Championship will affect their careers.', 'As things stand both George and Itoje, currently on England duty, are committed to remaining but are unsure how many of their teammates will be able to do likewise. “We haven’t got all the answers yet,” George said. “It’s a difficult one. We are 80 or 90% of the way to knowing what’s going on but there’s still a few bits to work out. I won’t lie to you, there is a lot going on. We are obviously feeling for the boys at the club who are having to deal with it day in, day out. Coming away into [England’s] camp was almost a relief … we’ve something else to focus on.”', 'Worcester’s Michael Fatialofa has begun a process of rehabilitation having spent three weeks in intensive care recovering from the serious spinal cord injury he sustained playing against Saracens in January.', 'Fatialofa posted a video on Instagram yesterday showing him moving his toes and lifting his legs while taking tentative steps at a specialist spinal clinic at the Royal Buckinghamshire hospital in Aylesbury. The 27-year-old has been transferred there after spending four weeks at London’s St Mary’s hospital, the majority of which was in intensive care.', 'Fatialofa was injured in a collision during the defeat at Saracens on 4 January which held up play for 15 minutes while the lock received treatment.\\xa0', '“Six weeks deep. Doctors didn’t know me,” Fatialofa wrote on Instagram. “Could be years of grinding ahead but determined to get out of this chair.”', 'Spectators who attend Worcester’s Premiership game against Bath at Sixways tomorrow will be given a leaflet asking them to\\xa0donate to the JustGiving page that\\xa0has been set up to support Fatialofa and his wife Tatiana. Saracens have also pledged to donate £1,000 for every try they score at home to Sale. Sachin Nakrani', 'Itoje also revealed it “felt like an invasion of privacy” when the full independent report detailing his image rights arrangements with the club was leaked, making public a significant amount of joint investment detail. “It wasn’t ideal, to be honest. It felt like an invasion of privacy but some things are out of your control.', '“When I entered into [the agreements] they were all – to my knowledge, based on anything I got told – above board. There wasn’t even the slightest thought of it being not allowed by the salary cap manager. Obviously the situation is very different now. It is very clear that whatever you do, you have to get it checked.”', 'Itoje, though, is not so keen for players’ salaries to become a routine matter of public record in future – “I wouldn’t want anybody or everybody knowing exactly what I’m earning … I don’t think there’s a genuine need for that” – and would clearly prefer the furore to go away. “No one at the club wanted this to happen and no one at the club envisaged this would happen. So I don’t want to sit here and say: ‘It was this person’s fault or that person’s fault.’ I’m not here to point fingers.”', 'George was more forthcoming on the emotions he has experienced since Saracens’ original fine and points deduction were announced in early November. “It’s difficult to put one word on it. [At first] you’re angry or upset but find a way to find the positives. Then something else happens and you go through it again. We’ll be challenged this season more than we’ve ever been and probably again next season. We’ve got to make sure that we fight to keep the club afloat really.', '“I guess we as players feel a responsibility to pay back what the club have given us. They have shown a huge amount of loyalty to me, as well as remorse in terms of what they have done. That is appreciated. I don’t feel let down. The opportunities that Nigel Wray has given to me as a person from the age of 17 … he has invested so much time and love in me so I will be for ever grateful for that.”', 'Quite how easy the club’s senior players will find it to juggle Championship rugby with retaining their England starting places under Eddie Jones while also pushing their Lions claims remains to be seen.', 'George, now 29, is trying to look on the bright side – “It might be an opportunity to rest a little bit more which you don’t really get at this stage of your career” – but not everyone’s circumstances are the same.', '“The conversations are ongoing with Eddie and [Saracens’ director of rugby] Mark McCall,” George said. “I think it will be different for each individual but I want to stay at the club and be part of the transition going forward. I didn’t get any offers from France; maybe they aren’t interested. But I haven’t been looking.', '“For me the pinnacle of my career is playing for England and further, so for that to be the case I need to be in the country. There is talk of playing pretty competitive games in South Africa and talk of actually playing against South Africa. Games like that will be essential.”', 'England, meanwhile, are still hopeful that Manu Tuilagi may be fit to feature against Ireland on Sunday week having been injured in the first half against France and sat out the Scotland game with a sore groin.

That happened during the World Cup when he failed two head injury assessments in 11 days following collisions against Australia and Fiji.', 'It was a tournament run by World Rugby whose rules stipulate that any player suffering two concussions in a year must be independently assessed after passing the return to play protocols, but there is no obligation on teams to do so in the Six Nations.', 'The Welsh Rugby Union’s national medical manager Prav Mathema insists on independent consultation after a repeat concussion and in recent years Leigh Halfpenny, George North and Patchell have all had extended layoffs. Biggar is in the care of Northampton this week under Premiership regulations because there are no Six Nations matches, but he will not be considered for Sunday’s home match against Bristol.', '“Dan is doing the normal return to play protocols,” said Wales’s assistant coach, Neil Jenkins. “That takes a bit of time but he is recovering well and we hope he will be OK for next week. The World Cup was a concern in terms of the heavy knocks that he had, but I don’t think Saturday was as bad as those.', '“A head injury assessment is still something that you’ve got to do and the right decision was made [to leave him out against Ireland]. He is a tough old player, as you could see on Saturday because trying to get him off was an issue. He will do everything to be ready to face France.”', 'Wales have not brought another fly-half into the squad even though they are down to two in Biggar and his replacement in Dublin, Cardiff’s Jarrod Evans, although Patchell is likely to be recalled if he makes his return for Scarlets on the weekend of the France match.', 'Wales’s wing Josh Adams, who scored a hat-trick of tries against Italy in the opening round, will be fit to face France. He was replaced after 25 minutes against Ireland after being unable to run off a knock on his hip, but he is expected to resume training at the end of the week.', '“Josh is recovering and going through his treatment,” Jenkins said. “He is one of our leading lights who was outstanding in the World Cup and in the two games so far up until his injury. Josh is spending most of the time with the medics and will train when he is ready to go.', '“We have reviewed the Ireland game and though we were under the pump at times, it was a match we would have won but for errors. We know how strong France are: they would probably have beaten us in the World Cup but for a sending off.

Madley will officiate non-league matches for the remainder of this season.', '“Like any referee I have the desire to perform at my best and to achieve the best I can,” Madley wrote on his blog, therefereesword. “I know how hard that road is to referee at the top but I have the desire and passion to work hard to achieve my potential whatever that may be. I still have dreams that I thought were dead but for me they are now very much alive.”', 'Madley was removed from the Premier League list of referees in August 2018 after a video of him mocking a disabled man was shared with his employer, the PGMOL. Last year he described it as a private joke taken out of context but accepted it was “badly misjudged”.', '“I have never tried to excuse my actions of 2018,” Madley wrote in his latest post. “I have never looked to blame anyone but myself. I am not proud of my actions in 2018 and I have learned from this and feel I am a better and stronger person for it.', '“PGMOL dealt with what they considered a discriminatory act in the strongest way. There can be no criticism for that and I have never sought to do anything other than respect the decision and to learn from it as a person. I can only thank them for having the ability to forgive, recognise that one naive moment does not define a person and offer me a second chance to do what I love to do.”', 'Since losing his job Madley has refereed in Norway, where he has been living.

I have no clue how far we can go but there’s no need to think about it yet because at the moment all we need to concentrate on is Atlético on Tuesday.”', 'Having been to the last two finals many believe Liverpool are the strongest team left in the competition, certainly the one most feared by opponents, though Klopp is happy just to be alive and fighting.', '“I have no clue if we can win the Champions League again but we should be ready to go for it,” he said. “What I know and what we showed last year is that we can beat the best. It doesn’t mean we will, it just means we can, and that is the only thing I have to know. There are so many strong teams out there you have to ready for the fight, then it’s about luck in certain moments to win anything. In the end the quality within a squad is not always the biggest difference; it’s more about who can find the right mood, show the most desire, be decisive in the right moment. And luck. To win anything you will need that for sure.”', 'Before setting off for Spain the league leaders face a trip to Norwich on Saturday to take on the team bottom of the table. “People think it will be easy, but that is not how this league is,” Klopp said. “We have to make sure we don’t go there thinking it will be easy. We have been preparing all week – and it is the dream of every manager to have a full week to prepare for a match – as if this game is going to be the most important of our lives.”', 'Norwich lost 4-1 at Anfield on the first day of the season but Klopp was still impressed. “They scored a goal and could have had more,” he said. “They stuck to their principles when they went behind, and that is what they are still doing in the Premier League. Norwich seem capable of causing most teams they play against real problems yet they find it hard to win enough games. That’s how strong this league is.

The former Saracens chairman also covered renovations costs.', 'Although no players were at fault for the breaches, the fallout for Saracens has been catastrophic. Initially they were handed a 35-point deduction but having refused to a mid-season audit and acknowledged they will be over the salary cap this season, Premiership Rugby hit them with another 70-point deduction which rubber-stamped their relegation.', 'Jamie George became the first of their England internationals to confirm he intends to stay at the club next season with Mako Vunipola revealing he is in negotiations over following suit. A number of their younger players on the fringes of international setups are set to leave however, to avoid spending a year in the Championship, which has just been hit by funding cuts of 50% for next season.', 'Vunipola however, was adamant that if Wray approached him over a potential co-investment again he would accept in order to secure his future once his career is over. The 29-year-old said: “No regrets at all. If I had the choice to do it again, I would do it again knowing what has happened.', '“That is no slight at not caring about what has happened to the club, but more the fact that I know rugby is important, but our careers are short and I want to look ahead a bit.

For us as rugby players, we deal with it every day and it is something that we are used to. But when people are saying stuff about you and you have family who care about you, it affects them.', '“When we first got told that we had minus 35 was a low moment. And then when they announced we were definitely relegated was probably the lowest. Because as a team, when we had that first fine we understood it and thought: ‘We can get after this’.

In Durban he was brief but devastating with the bat, defibrilating England’s innings from a standing start. An hour into this second match England had stalled a little at 125 for five off 15 overs batting first. Joe Denly had lasted two balls in his specialist all-purpose filler role.', 'Enter the man they said couldn’t start against pace. At Kingsmead Moeen set off like a bullet train. His second delivery, a cutter from Andile Phehlukwayo, was clumped over long-on. Beuran Hendricks was lifted over deep square leg then pinged over long-off.

First he produced a counter-balance to Moeen’s barrage; by the time he was out for 65 off 22 balls, it was one of the most extraordinary innings you could hope to see in this format.', 'Still running hot, Moeen took the new ball in the chase. His first over went for five. At which point De Kock switched to his most elegantly murderous mode. Moeen’s third over went for 20 as De Kock lifted and cuffed and monstered him for three huge sixes.', 'Next De Kock took the long handle to Curran. He went to his fifty off 17 balls, the fastest by a South African. On 69 without loss after six, then 102 off 10, they were hurtling toward England’s score. De Kock was finally out mis-hitting a near waist-high full toss from Mark Wood to the midwicket fence. T20 isn’t always an elegant game, but this was the most beautiful display of batting violence.', 'Earlier South Africa had won the toss and bowled on a powder blue evening. England picked an unchanged XI, as Dawid Malan continued his long walk to maybe getting a game somewhere on tour. Jos Buttler opened again, still dining out on those slightly over-valued IPL half-centuries.', 'Early on Ngidi nipped one away and Buttler nicked it. He now has 78 in his last five innings as England’s T20 opener. No matter though. Recent history suggests England will just keep playing him there until the opportunity to be proved right presents itself.', 'At other end Jason Roy lifted Fortuin’s fifth ball over mid-off for six like a man clearing his throat. England were 55 for one at the end of the sixth over. That adrenal finish set up the game.', 'Enter De Kock, half an hour of violence, and a dismissal that left South Africa needing 113 off 12 overs. Mark Wood bowled quickly to remove Temba Bavuma. South Africa needed 82 off 45 as England turned the screw, Chris Jordan bowling with skill and pace as the chase began to bite.', 'The lower order was left chasing 45 off 18, but Wood’s final over went for 19. South Africa needed 15 off the last. Curran got away with one slower ball but saw his second clubbed for a huge six by Dwaine Pretorius. Curran struck back, producing fine yorkers to get rid of Pretorius, then dismiss the desperate Fortuin. England stay alive, just.']","England in South Africa 2019-20","Sport","2020-02-14",20.25,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2c005bb7b96af015a1becbfe5549c4cb128eb0/0_138_3449_2070/master/3449.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=092d302bcd17556603447eb27ce2ee71","Tom Curran celebrates the final wicket after he bowled three fine yorkers as England snatched T20 victory over South Africa.

  ["How 'leaked' emails and invoices led to Manchester City's ban from Europe","['Uefa investigation was greeted with scorn and denial by the club, but has culminated in a guilty verdict ']","['Throughout the startling “leaks” of Manchester City’s internal emails in the German magazine Der Spiegel, and the resulting investigation by Uefa which led ultimately to Friday’s guilty finding and two-season Champions League ban and €30m (£25m) fine, City’s response has been uniform: scorn, outrage, denial.', 'The emails, splashed by Spiegel with evident relish across a series of exposés, punched into City’s expertly and expensively created modern image in three broad areas relating to Uefa’s financial fair play rules, which were introduced in 2011 to deter clubs from overspending.', 'First, and most damaging, were emails and accounting documents which appeared to show that City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour, of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, was mostly funding the huge, £67.5m annual sponsorship of the club’s shirt, stadium and academy by his country’s airline, Etihad. That created a perception that the Abu Dhabi hierarchy, in their drive to mega-spend on City attaining elite status while somehow complying with FFP rules, had deceived Uefa in their financial submissions. This serious trouble for City sprang from a tiny number of emails, a fraction of the documentary dump provided to Spiegel by its source, Rui Pinto, a Portuguese national now charged in his home country with 147 criminal offences including computer hacking, all of which he denies.', 'FFP rules limit the amount of money owners can put in to bankroll losses, encouraging top-division European clubs not to overspend on players’ wages and transfer fees and risk falling into financial crisis, and to spend within their revenues. Mansour started financing mega-losses on player signings and wages after his 2008 takeover and City had scrambled, particularly following the introduction of FFP in 2011, to turbo-boost their revenues with large sponsorships from Abu Dhabi companies.', 'One of the emails, from City’s then chief financial officer, Jorge Chumillas, headed “Cashflow”, stated that Mansour’s own company vehicle, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), would be paying £57m as a “contribution to 13/14 sponsorship fee”, while only £8m was Etihad’s “direct contribution”. Then Chumillas sent invoices for Etihad, internally to the City executives Ferran Soriano and Simon Pearce, stating that for 2015-16, the Etihad sponsorship was £67.5m, of which “£8m should be funded directly by Etihad and £59.5 [sic] by ADUG”.', 'Following the Spiegel coverage, Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) investigatory chamber (IC) finally announced last March that it was launching an investigation, and City responded by saying they would comfortably prove that the accusations were “entirely false”. The IC, a panel of grandees chaired by Yves Leterme, a former Belgian prime minister, was clearly not convinced, however, after its inquiry which involved two days of hearings, and it charged the club in May. City responded with scorn, accusing the IC of ignoring “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence”, said the decision was the result of “mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process”, and in effect accused the IC of being biased, running “a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed, and hostile process”.', 'City expressed huge outrage that the IC’s pending decision to charge was leaked two days early – which was indeed embarrassing to Uefa – although the truth is that throughout the process, very little detail has leaked. The fact that the IC did charge City, though, made it self-evident that the hierarchy’s explanations, and whatever documentation they did provide, did not satisfy the IC that questions raised by the club’s own internal communications had been irrefutably answered.', 'The IC can reasonably have expected City to produce, for example, the internal replies to Chumillas’s stunning emails, which perhaps would show he had been corrected, or that in context it could be shown that it was simply, “irrefutably”, not the case that ADUG was funding the Etihad sponsorship. Instead, the IC clearly decided that the allegations had not been refuted, and sent them for determination by Uefa’s CFCB adjudicatory chamber, which is chaired by José Narciso da Cunha Rodrigues, a former general prosecutor in Portugal and judge at the European Court of Justice, and includes a leading British barrister, Charles Flint QC.', 'These public responses after the charges were laid were consistent with the second element exposed by the emails: how hostile and confrontational City had been to Uefa, and to FFP itself, throughout the process of compliance – at times distastefully so. FFP applied to all top-flight clubs across Europe competing in the Champions and Europa Leagues, seeking to encourage long-term football development and dampen player wage inflation, with detailed new regulations and a sophisticated reporting system developed by Uefa with blue-chip accountants.', 'City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, was never a major supporter of FFP, seeing it as a restraint of Mansour’s freedom to rebuild City by pouring money in, but the emails showed the resistance went further. It seemed as if the hierarchy had almost taken it personally, feeling that this whole FFP system was a protectionist move to stop Mansour’s extravagance challenging the established superclubs. Perhaps there was something of that in the support for FFP given by Bayern Munich and the German clubs in particular, but they were trying to maintain financial sustainability in the Bundesliga where most clubs are still ultimately controlled by supporters. They and many other clubs in Europe felt it was alien to the game’s traditions for Gulf sovereign investors to buy clubs and spend their way to success.', 'City perceived their plans for rapid accession to the Champions League elite were challenged by FFP, and persistently threatened a legal challenge. The club’s inhouse lawyer Simon Cliff wrote in one of the published emails that Mubarak had told Gianni Infantino, then Uefa’s general secretary, that he would not accept a financial sanction for exceeding the permitted €45m loss in 2012 and 2013, and said: “He would rather spend 30 million on the 50 best lawyers in the world to sue [Uefa] for the next 10 years.”', 'In 2014, the IC determined that City had a deficit of €180m over that two-year period, vastly in excess of the €45m permitted, and in May that year agreed a settlement which some at Uefa believed was too lenient. A day before that, the former chair of the IC, Jean-Luc Dehaene, a distinguished former prime minister of Belgium and senior EU politician, died aged 73, survived by his wife of 49 years and their four children. Spiegel quoted Cliff’s reaction to this news in an internal email, referring to the membership of the IC: “1 down, 6 to go.”', 'Since its exposure, no one from City has apologised for that email, apparently due to the stance that the emails were hacked, so the contents, however unfortunate, are not to be acknowledged.', 'The third element revealed in the leaked material did not mostly form part of the IC’s investigation, having been dealt with as part of the 2014 settlement, but it revealed the extent to which City had engaged in some creative accounting to persuade Uefa it had complied with the new “break-even” rules. Most of these restructurings had been spotted and disallowed by the IC and the consultants, PwC, it sent to peer into the detail.', 'Following the publication of the leaks, City refused to respond at all to Spiegel, the rest of the media and to Uefa, until the IC, having initially responded uncertainly, decided it had to investigate. City denounced the use of the emails as “out-of-context materials purportedly hacked or stolen”, and alleged there was an “organised and clear attempt to damage the club’s reputation”.', 'Spiegel anonymised its source as “John” in the coverage, and quoted him denying that he acquired his vaults of 70m documents from football strongholds as a result of hacks, saying he had good contacts. Within weeks he was identified as Pinto, now on remand in a Lisbon prison awaiting trial, charged with alleged hacking and other offences, although only against Portuguese clubs and institutions, not City or Uefa. Pinto acknowledged to Spiegel in December that there was hacking software on his computer, and “some of my acts may be considered illegal”, but denied he had committed criminal offences, saying: “I don’t consider myself a hacker.”', 'But for people, or organisations such as City, who find they are victims of leaks, or hacks, there is a deeply uncomfortable contradiction to the consequences. However justified their outrage, if the documents reveal possible wrongdoing, then regulators or governing bodies are duty bound to investigate.', 'Now, after a review of the evidence and a hearing last month, the AC has decided like the IC, that City’s hierarchy have been damned by their own internal material. For all the fury and belligerence of their response, the club have not explained away the impression and apparent evidence that they deceived European football’s governing body with their financial submissions, even while they were spending huge money to star in its glittering competition.']","Manchester City","Sport","2020-02-14",18.47,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e647154c5750245af7e848d5a309a901d507ccd2/314_135_2525_1515/master/2525.jpg?width=1300&quality=85&fit=max&s=967c0b9c7e8c5f6bd99d558a291e90cb","Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne, Benjamin Mendy and Raheem Sterling reflect on last season’s dramatic Champions League defeat by Tottenham.

If the appeal is still going on when next season’s Champions League starts, City will be able to compete and, if Cas upholds the ban, it will start in 2021-22.', 'City were found guilty by Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) of having falsely inflated their sponsorship revenues, when they made submissions for the FFP compliance process. The guilty finding follows an investigation sparked by the publication of “leaked” emails and documents by the German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2018.', 'The “leaked” emails and documents appeared to show that City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, was mostly funding the huge, £67.5m annual sponsorship of the City shirt, stadium and academy by his country’s airline, Etihad. One of the leaked emails suggested that only £8m of that sponsorship in 2015-16 was funded directly by Etihad and the rest was coming from Mansour’s own company vehicle for the ownership of City, the Abu Dhabi United Group.', 'Manchester City alleged in their statement that the outcome had been prejudged from the beginning, and that the process was “flawed and consistently leaked”, saying the club was “disappointed but not surprised” by the decision. City said they will appeal against the ban and fine “at the earliest opportunity” at CAS. “The club has always anticipated the ultimate need to seek out an independent body and process to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence in support of its position,” the statement read.', '“Simply put, this is a case initiated by Uefa, prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa. With this prejudicial process now over, the club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible and will therefore, in the first instance, commence proceedings with the Court of Arbitration for Sport at the earliest opportunity.” A City source confirmed that Mansour remains fully committed to the club.', 'Uefa said in its statement: “The Adjudicatory Chamber, having considered all the evidence, has found that Manchester City committed serious breaches of the Uefa Financial Fair Play Regulations by overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016.', '“The Adjudicatory Chamber has also found that in breach of the regulations the club failed to cooperate in the investigation of this case by the CFCB.”', 'FFP, introduced in 2011 with the aim of encouraging football clubs across Europe not to overspend on players’ wages, restricts the amount club owners can put in to cover losses. Sponsorships boost revenues and therefore the amount clubs have to spend under FFP, so the perception that Mansour himself was funding the Etihad deal led to the serious allegation that City had deceived Uefa’s CFCB, which is responsible for ensuring compliance with FFP.', 'City have denied wrongdoing throughout and denounced the Spiegel coverage as based on “hacked or stolen” materials taken out of context. Spiegel anonymised its source as “John”, who was quoted as saying he had not hacked computers to obtain the emails.', 'Shortly after their publication, he was identified as a Portuguese national, Rui Pinto, who has now been charged in Portugal with 147 criminal offences, including hacking and other cybercrimes, which he denies. The charges relate only to Portuguese football clubs and other organisations, not to the “leaks” of City’s or Uefa’s emails.', 'When City were charged last May, they said that they had been subjected to a “hostile” process which ignored “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence”.']","Manchester City","Sport","2020-02-14",18.27,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f68464a134c62dcd6c218295cde28053bd6c0441/0_273_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=7c7656d1e5762898e5498c89d711acce","Manchester City have been banned from the Champions League by Uefa.

  ["Why doesn't boxing care about gender-based violence?","['The Gervonta Davis video is the latest example of the boxing industry’s structural inadequacy and self-serving indifference when it comes to holding abusers of women to account']","['Earlier this month Gervonta Davis, the World Boxing Association’s lightweight champion and one of America’s most prodigiously gifted young athletes, was shown in a widely circulated video choking the mother of his child in front of hundreds of people at a charity basketball game on the campus of the University of Miami.', 'The short clip of the incident, which has been viewed more than 7.6m times, is stomach-turning. But maybe not for reasons that are immediately obvious on first viewing.', 'Watch it again and look at the shock on the faces of the young girls in the foreground as the scene abruptly ignites. Look at the man seated to the woman’s left who literally stands up and walks away when Davis yanks her from her chair. Look at the reaction of the nearby security guard twice Davis’s size who hardly bats an eye, like this is a common occurrence, as he allows the boxer to close his hands around the woman’s throat before all but clearing a path for him to drag her into the darkness beneath the stands.', 'Had Davis been putting his hands on a man in the same way, you can bet that a dozen other men would have flailed into the situation to break things up. But it was a woman. And it was allowed to happen while a whole group of children watched. Ultimately, no one but Davis himself can be blamed for what unfolded, but the optics of indifference on display in those 14 seconds paint a chilling picture.', 'Davis immediately took to social media for damage control as the video rapidly spread, claiming “I never once hit her” on his since-wiped Instagram, only to voluntarily surrender to Coral Gables police three days later on a charge of simple battery domestic violence. An arrest report acquired by the Guardian stated that a surveillance camera in the room they disappeared into “shows a partial view of the defendant pulling his arm back and then forward towards the victim, which is consistent with a strike to the face where the victim sustained injuries to her lip and left jaw”.', 'You’re reading about this particular case only because Davis is a famous athlete. He came up the hard way from abject poverty in west Baltimore, learned to box under the trainer who inspired the Cutty character in The Wire and excelled to become the sport’s second-youngest world champion at just 22 years old. He is the type of homegrown property with a compelling backstory and crowd-pleasing style that makes US television executives salivate. Under Armour saw enough in Davis to sign him to a sponsorship deal and plaster billboards with his image, a rare mainstream breakthrough in a sport that’s increasingly been ignored by major brands. (An Under Armour spokesperson told the Guardian the company parted ways with Davis “a while ago” but did not respond to follow-up questions about the terms of the contract and the reason it ended.)', 'But the story here is not Gervonta Davis. That’s a copout that allows us to otherize a single young black man who participates in a sport broadly associated with violence, as if gender-based abuse isn’t happening all around us, in every culture and in every segment of society, with countless survivors either afraid to report it or without the benefit of video footage to back up their claims. This is not about boxers being violent. Or athletes who participate in violent sports being violent. Or even that sportspeople from distressed backgrounds are violent.', 'Men are violent. White and black, rich and poor. Impunity for violence against women is as universal an issue as issues get. And everyone must call it out when they see it because the longer we keep looking the other way, the more it’s bound to keep happening. And this is where boxing as an industry, specifically, is failing. The sport has demonstrated one time after another that it is structurally ill-equipped to hold transgressors like Davis responsible and deliver legitimate repercussions for their actions.', 'Athletes in America’s most popular sports like football, basketball and baseball are (at last) being punished harshly for gender-based violence, through suspensions or the loss of endorsement deals, but we have yet to see boxers face the same consequences. On some level, putting aside the normalization of the abuse of women in our society, it fits into the framework of how the broader public understands a sport like boxing. Violence begets violence, it’s thought. But that, too, is a fallacy.', 'The problem is inherent in the sport’s decentralized power structure. Boxers are independent contractors and the absence of a central governing body means any form of discipline would have to come from the networks and the promoters, who have a direct financial stake in a fighter’s public profile and ability to generate revenue. Any of the individual athletic commissions which sanction the sport on a state-by-state basis could put their foot down and deny a fighter the license required to fight in their boundaries, but there will always be another state waiting with open arms to deliver a big-ticket event, and the economic impact it brings, to their backyard. Same goes for the networks, in this case Showtime, which has made no small investment in broadcasting Davis’s past seven fights either on premium cable or on pay-per-view. They have declined to comment on the matter but their position doesn’t require any extraordinary insight to divine. They are a publicly traded company answerable to their shareholders, fully aware their rivals in a space where market share is a zero-sum game would be falling over themselves to sign Davis if they dropped him. They want to be responsible, but they also want to remain in business.', 'Truth is, the same power brokers who dress boxing up as the biggest sport in the world for a couple of nights a year are more than content to have it spend the rest of the calendar in the shadows, where incidents like these barely make the news and can be marginalized during the next money-spinning promotion. So once the commission has passed off the responsibility to the network, and the network has passed it off to the consumer, the entire operation is dependent on the public’s indifference when it comes to violence against women.', 'There is simply no existing incentive to take a strong disciplinary stand when time and again it’s been proven that any stigma resultant from instances of gender-based violence does nothing to compromise a fighter’s market value. In fact, many boxers have been rewarded in the immediate aftermath, essentially profiting off their notoriety. Mike Tyson’s first fight back after serving a three-year prison sentence on a rape conviction, despite being a glorified exhibition, remains one of the highest-grossing events in the sport’s history. And Floyd Mayweather Jr, who mentored Davis for years, was handed a quarter-billion dollar contract from Showtime and CBS only months after serving a 60-day sentence in a Nevada county jail for a domestic abuse conviction in 2013. Maddeningly, to promote his first fight under the record-smashing deal, Showtime infamously televised an hour-long infomercial, produced by Mayweather, which reframed his incarceration as an obstacle to be overcome on the comeback trail.', 'Boxers, contrary to the public perception, are not more prone to violence outside the ring than anyone else. Putting aside the many studies that show athletes in violent sports commit gender-based violence at a lower rate than the general population (since rates are unreliable and essentially meaningless due to underreporting); anecdotally, any boxing lifer will tell you the sport does far more to drill violence out of adolescents who come from at-risk circumstances than it’s done to exacerbate aggressive tendencies, teaching its practitioners to control and channel extreme impulses toward productive ends.', 'Which is to say I am pretty sure what happened that night in Coral Gables has nothing to do with Gervonta Davis being a boxer. But until the machine which profits from him can find a way to place something between Davis and the next big payday besides an Instagram mea culpa, there’s no incentive for him to assume responsibility for his behavior and the cycle is bound to repeat itself. The only question is whether anyone with a seat at the table will care. No one but Davis himself can be directly blamed for what happened in that gym, just as no single party is entirely responsible for an industry’s inability to hold abusers to account. But as is clear in those 14 seconds, the failure of the whole collective is impossible to deny.']","Boxing","Sport","2020-02-14",8,"Fri","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef972404baa9b866d5f44099294a17f11de9e09/0_155_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=401fd7c03e83aa2c34798f018814b2cf","Baltimore’s Gervonta Davis, right, a world champion in two weight classes at 25 years old, is one of America’s most talented young boxers.

He gave a measured answer, saying he would first discuss with his team whether they would make a gesture and how best to do that rather than making off-the-cuff commitments.', '“It will be discussed amongst ourselves\\xa0and we’ll decide how we’ll go forward as a team,” Holder said. “But I don’t want to sit here and speak for the other members without consulting them.\\xa0I think that would be wrong.\\xa0', '“I just want to make sure\\xa0that\\xa0whatever we do – if we do anything – is done the right way. And if we do decide to show some sort of solidarity we make sure that everybody is on the same page. For me the greatest thing at the end of the day is unity. We must all come together, there must be equality across the world.”', 'Before diverting to the peculiarities of this\\xa0cricket\\xa0tour Holder also spoke about the need for education. “A\\xa0lot of people live\\xa0but\\xa0do\\xa0not know exactly what goes on around them and this is the perfect time to educate yourselves and make a change.”\\xa0', 'Holder has always been party to the discussions with the England and Wales Cricket Board around what a possible tour to England might look like. “We obviously had our internal discussions with Cricket West Indies as well and we just tried to gather as much information as possible,” he said. “Having that information was crucial to be able to then answer any questions from the players.\\xa0At no point in time\\xa0did\\xa0we force anybody to come. Everybody had their free will.”\\xa0', 'In the end, three players – Darren Bravo, Shimron Hetmyer and Keemo Paul – chose not to be available.', 'First impressions upon landing in England were favourable. “To be honest, I feel pretty safe,” Holder said. “I must commend the ECB; they’ve been outstanding. We had a chartered airline and arriving here yesterday in Manchester was pretty smooth. We just transferred directly from the plane through\\xa0the\\xa0VIP arrival hall and then from there straight on to the buses directly to the hotel.”', 'The players will be locked away throughout their stay but Holder explained that they have prepared for that and it is not so different from some\\xa0of their\\xa0tours to the subcontinent. And he wants to play some cricket.\\xa0', '“Oh man, I’ve been sat at home for the last couple of months doing nothing. So to be getting some cricket, doing something I love,\\xa0is great\\xa0and I think most of the guys feel the same way. We haven’t had competitive cricket for a while.

  ["AFL enters unknown territory with much up in the air as season restarts","['The resumption of the 2020 season has given the competition a degree of certainty but also thrown up many questions']","['Nobody remembers who came second. It is a maxim that is in line for a searching examination when the 2020 AFL premiership season resumes on Thursday night at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the rugby league stronghold states of New South Wales and Queensland, the consensus is that the NRL won the race by restarting its season sooner than any code in the country. Ask those further south and out west, and there never was a race at all.', 'The NRL did beat the AFL to the punch, however, returning two weeks prior and raking in the enormous TV ratings that come with the “clear air” that the ARLC chairman Peter V’landys so craves. In slashing its way through political red tape, the NRL also prised open a conversation about the return of professional sport that might otherwise have been some time coming. For this, the AFL can be grateful.', 'But while V’landys drew plaudits from those within rugby league for getting the job done, the applause was matched by censure in the wider community that condemned a man for apparently putting sport ahead of the public interest.\\xa0', 'And this is reflected in the rhetoric. Where V’landys moved ahead without the initial buy-in of government and health officials, the AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan engaged in working relationships with states and territories. Where V’landys likes to fan the flames – “I do like annoying the Victorians … at times I’ve looked at them and had a giggle” – McLachlan plumps for diplomacy. “I don’t pay any attention,” he said this week on Fox Footy. “For those who want to compete, let’s see where we are at the end of the year and what the scoreboard looks like. For the rest like me who don’t really care, good luck to all sports to get through this.”', 'Although we can look ahead with a degree of certainty, there is still much up in the air.', 'Quarantine protocols and border restrictions remain varied across the country, leading the AFL to release its revised fixtures in blocks of four rounds. The AFL might have attracted widespread praise for getting its season away, but cries of inequity continue to be heard over the competitive disadvantage facing the four clubs from Western Australia and South Australia to be domiciled in hubs on the Gold Coast.', 'A brouhaha is in the offing over this, with the players’ association lobbying the AFL for teams to spend no more than four weeks away from home. Premiership fancies West Coast are unsurprisingly strong advocates of this, as well as a make-good run of home games to end the season.', 'As things stand, when the siren sounds to commence the clash between Richmond and Collingwood, the AFL remains without a broadcast rights deal for this 17-round season. Even the grand final can be no more than be pencilled in for 24 October, McLachlan conceding the “last weekend in December” is still an option if further interruptions are brought on by the pandemic.', 'So there are twists and turns still to be negotiated before the season is done. But now, having scaled the molehill of round one, the AFL’s 18 clubs stand at the foot of a mountain, the summit of which remains shrouded by the fog of Covid-19. For months the narrative has centred on containment, isolation and, for professional footballers, a season that might never be. Now, suddenly, there is a premiership to be won.\\xa0', 'And everything is new. Players and coaching staff are accustomed to merely days between rounds. Eleven weeks have passed since the season was abruptly paused. What lessons were learned from round one? How will clubs have spent the hiatus, tinkering and remodelling a gameplan that might have floundered in March but could flourish in June?', 'How will teams utilise the interchange bench? Most finished round one with plenty of rotations up their sleeves, a clear nod to shorter quarters and the consequent need for fewer changes. Will this become a trend or, with player fitness a great unknown, will rotations head north?', 'It is worth noting teams have had just four contact training sessions to fit them for the resumption of the season. How will players cope with stands that are empty or near empty? What of the teams relocated on the Gold Coast? How advantaged are the clubs who, for now, will play a disproportionate number of games from the comfort of home?', 'These are questions that will be answered as the fullness, or otherwise, of this unique season unravels. The asterisk that will forever accompany the 2020 premiers is spoken of in negative terms by most, but not McLachlan.', '“I think they’ll have an asterisk to say it’s one of the great premierships,” he said. “Whoever wins the flag this year will obviously have delivered on the field, and they will have had to be the most disciplined, resilient, deep, competitive, mentally tough team off the field. It will be an unbelievable premiership to win.”', 'Follow the build up to the season restart and the game between Richmond and Collingwood with the Guardian’s liveblog from 3pm AEDT on Thursday.']","AFL","Sport","2020-06-10",18.3,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6522bac00b29e9e511eca355acec909375ec327/0_283_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=d4c4daf909076ff02969570ba1222e3a","Dustin Martin and Richmond get the AFL season back under way against Collingwood on Thursday night.

Before that his last competitive outing was at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December 2019. Using the current season’s cars is banned under regulations so Hamilton took to the track using the Mercedes W09 from 2018, a car with which he won the world championship. With the season starting with an intense programme of three races in succession, putting in time behind the wheel in advance was seen as essential.', 'Hamilton completed a substantial period of running in wet and dry conditions and pronounced himself very satisfied with the results.', '“When you leave the garage the first time, you get this buzz, and it doesn’t matter how many years you do it, it always feels new and fresh,” he said. “Obviously this is an older car, but it still felt fantastic. We got through a solid programme today.', '“I didn’t feel like I’ve ever left the water, so that’s a positive. Every time you take a big break – I think it’s been 103 days or something – you always wonder whether you can still drive. So it’s a good feeling to know of course I can, I’m ready, I feel fit.”', 'Mercedes ran a similar test for Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, on Tuesday and applied their new operating protocols across both days. F1 is intending to run each race as a closed biosphere and teams are expected to commit to minimising risks.', 'The Mercedes crew operated wearing face masks, and in some cases full facial protection for team members who had to operate in proximity to drivers – such as when they are being strapped into the car. All team members were practising physical distancing and were tested for coronavirus before they got to the circuit. All returned negative results and Hamilton wore a face mask when he was not in the car.', 'The team implemented a range of procedures including a full grid-start simulation. When racing resumes the starting-grid process will involve a far more limited number of personnel than is usual.', 'Ferrari are expected to run a similar programme at their test track in Fiorano. The F1 season opens with races in Austria on 5 and 12 July before a third in Budapest on 19 July, all held behind closed doors.

  ["Martin Braithwaite: 'Middlesbrough to Barcelona, it's been a hell of a journey'","['Denmark striker seemed an unlikely signing for Barcelona but has been proving people wrong ever since he spent two years in a wheelchair as a child']","['The more Martin Braithwaite crept round behind her back, the more suspicious his wife grew and by the time he came clean she had already rumbled him. “She felt something going on because I was having a lot of phone calls, sneaking out the house when it was freezing outside,” the Denmark striker says, stopping, laughing and starting up again. “She was wondering, almost asking if I have a mistress or something. And the night I said: ‘I have to tell you something.’ She said: ‘I know what you’re going to say.’”', 'The secret had slipped out: Braithwaite was joining Barcelona. He had kept quiet for weeks until he was certain it would happen and if he wasn’t telling Anne-Laure, he wasn’t telling anyone.', '“But the day I wanted to tell her, everything broke, my phone got bombarded all day. I was thinking ‘oh, shit’. Her phone was the same, so she wasn’t surprised when I sat her down. I was disappointed I couldn’t get that shock reaction but she was really happy and she understood that I didn’t tell her.”', 'Just two days later the man who had played – or, too often, hadn’t played – in the Championship for Middlesbrough and had just escaped a relegation battle with Leganés\\xa0was running on to the Camp Nou pitch to join Lionel Messi. This was it, and the first time he got the ball in a decent position, he looked up, steadied himself, and ... sliced it into the stands.', 'Braithwaite is laughing now. It helps he knows what comes next – a hand in two goals, including an assist for Messi, whose embrace prompted him to joke, “I won’t wash this shirt” – but he even then he was not disturbed. “It’s funny,” he says. “I think my head doesn’t work like others. I didn’t think about that for a second. Afterwards people said: ‘It shows your character: you did a huge mistake, you looked like you couldn’t play football, kicking the ball miles away’ … and it just got me smiling because football, life, is about taking risks.', '“If you walk around in a bubble and don’t try to get out, you’ll be safe but you’ll never learn. I’m not afraid to make mistakes or embarrass myself. When babies learn to walk, they don’t judge themselves when they fall. Keep going, keep learning.”', 'Look where you may end up. Listen to how enthusiastically he embraces the opportunity, the education. Even before joining Leganés, Braithwaite spent weeks watching videos, analysing their play, what chances would fall his way. At Leganés, that meant getting close to Guido Carrillo. At Barcelona, it means Messi – the man of whom he said: “If football’s a religion, he’s its God.”', '“Messi takes attention away. People forget to look at what’s happening around him because he’s such a threat. There’s space and we have to understand how to exploit that. Then when you do, [opponents] realise ‘these guys are making runs: watch out’ and then you’re giving space to Messi. It’s about intelligence,” he says.\\xa0“I was really excited to play with Luis Suárez, too. He was injured butnow he’s back and I’m looking at him: how he moves. I ask questions, I’m learning. The knowledge these players have is priceless.”', 'Coaching staff confirm they have rarely had a footballer ask so many questions, so determined to understand. “I don’t like to see myself as different but I am curious, I want to learn, think about the game differently, mentally and technically.”', 'Different to Middlesbrough, for sure. It’s hard to imagine two more contrasting managers than Quique Setién\\xa0and Tony Pulis; slightly bizarre to think the player who did not entirely succeed on Teesside is at Barcelona. Signed by Garry Monk, Braithwaite was not enamoured with Pulis’s approach while the manager described him as “ungrateful” for saying he could not imagine returning to Middlesbrough after his loan at Leganés. Some accused Braithwaite of not trying, something that simply does not fit with the man seen in Spain. Or, he says, the man there: “I’m the same person.”', '“I’m grateful,” he says. “I learnt a lot. I don’t have a problem [not playing] because a manager has hard decisions. I didn’t fit. That’s life. It’s normal, not personal. It adds different tools for me for the future. No hard feelings. Only, things were said that are far from the truth – some really, really bad comments after I left.', '“We’re human and football is full of emotion. Middlesbrough supporters are passionate and I loved that. I believe in freedom of speech; people are allowed to show their disappointment. I shared that disappointment. People next to me know my values. It’s just a shame some try to create a picture of me. But it’s part of who I’ve become, what I learnt, what brought me here. It’s been a hell of a journey.”', 'His Guyanese father and Danish mother met in the US, his wife is French and he had trials at Newcastle and Reggina, before playing in Denmark, England, France and Spain, when he might not have played at all.', '“I spent two years in a wheelchair. I had something called Legg-Calve-Perthes, a hip disease. You have to rest your hip, not put pressure on it, because it can turn soft and become deformed. I was really young, five to seven, and I don’t have a lot of memories. Before, I have memories. But it was a sad time so I think I erased this.\\xa0', '“My parents have explained it and I do remember wanting to play football, looking at everyone playing. I needed someone on me because I was trying to jump out of the wheelchair. My dad says when I played again it made him sad: he could see his son running around but he was limping.', '“People ask if I’ve brought that into my life. Not on a conscious level; subconsciously, maybe there’s something in me that’s helped me to be grateful and have an understanding. But consciously, no.”', 'Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3', 'Maybe it’s there in how he rejects the usual appeals for time to settle, in the refusal to waste time; perhaps in part too because he needs to convince quickly if he\\xa0is to stay at the Camp Nou for five years – and he is adamant that he will. “We only have now, we don’t have ‘in six months.’ We have to make time work for us. I just wanted to get started, I don’t like making excuses.”', 'He had barely started when he stopped again; 20 days into Braithwaite’s Barcelona career, lockdown began. He had to return to his home in Madrid, which did at least mean attending the birth of his fourth child, Valentino. “I’m really grateful,” he says, smiling. “I’ve heard a lot of people are getting a divorce [in lockdown] but I realised I really loved my wife: we got even closer.”', 'Lockdown also allowed for video analysis – “the perfect time” – and the chance to follow investments he and his uncle Philip – “more like a brother” – have in the US, a real estate project aimed at creating a new generation of investors, especially women and ethnic minorities. “We want to show people that as humans we’re powerful, more than we believe and we’re getting told.”', 'Conversation turns to events since the killing of George Floyd. “It’s terrible, it’s terrible. And I’m happy for the reaction, that people are getting together to change this. We’ve been seeing this too long, it’s sad [racism] is still happening. Football’s the biggest sport; it’s important we send a message.”', 'Back to the football, then. After all, on Saturday Barcelona return to La Liga action two points clear at the top with 11 games left, packed into a 30-day sprint. Three months and three matches since he arrived, the Barcelona career Braithwaite did not dare tell his wife about gets under way again, only different now. How does he imagine it?', '“I take inspiration from other sports, how they train the mind. I’m thinking: ‘Why aren’t we doing these things in football?’ I’m trying to bring this into my routine. Your body can’t tell the difference between reality and what you see in your mind, so you can improve through visualisation.', '“Usually when we imagine ourselves in a stadium, we see a full stadium; now I turn it around: I’m stepping on to a pitch where there’s no one. I’ve seen it so many times in my head now that it will be no surprise when it happens. Mentality will play a big part. You can’t say: ‘We lost points; next game we have to ...’ There’s no time for that.', '“I woke up today the way a kid wakes up for Christmas, with a big smile on my face.

  ["Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury agree terms of two-fight deal","['Eddie Hearn ‘looking at venues and dates’', 'First meeting of British pair to take place in 2021']","['Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury, Britain’s world heavyweight champions, are “making great progress” towards signing for a two-fight unification deal, according to Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn. The news has excited bookmakers but left more disinterested observers wondering when, where and if it will happen.', 'There is much wrangling to be done before the most anticipated fight in the business comes even close to fruition, although Hearn insists Joshua, who holds three versions of the title, and Fury, the unbeaten WBC champion, are already “in agreement regarding the financial terms”. That would seem to gel with a surprise statement last week by Frank Warren that his fighter, Fury, would be willing to split the purse 50‑50.', 'Such unanimity between promoters who have never even met, let alone exchanged civil words, is as rare as a trusted handshake in boxing, but at least the signs are encouraging. While Fury has captured attention beyond his sport with his giant personality, a story of redemption straight from Hollywood and a rousing stoppage of the American Deontay Wilder, Joshua has had to regain lost ground with the public after losing an unbeaten record and his title to Andy Ruiz last year. He did that with a convincing points victory in the rematch last December to win back his WBA, IBF and WBO belts, the bargaining chips he needed even to begin talks with Fury.', '“We’re making great progress,” Hearn told Sky Sports News. “There is still a lot to overcome. We are looking at venues and dates.', '“It’s fair to say [they] are in agreement regarding the financial terms of the fight. The main positive news is that Joshua and Fury have agreed to a two-fight deal, in essence. The most difficult part of any deal is the financial element. I believe we’re in a great place where both guys have agreed to what that should be. We have not signed contracts because there are still things to be worked out.', '“We’re pushing towards a place where they can be drafted, for 2021. Both guys are in agreement. The structure of the deal has been put forward, and agreed to by both parties.”', 'One hurdle is the pandemic that has paralysed sport. There was boxing of sorts on ESPN in the US this week, but without an audience, and it felt as flat as the canvas. Fighting in a near-empty hall robs pugilism of its essence, although Hearn still has plans to hold four nights of boxing over 28 days in July and August in the 15-acre grounds of his Matchroom headquarters in Romford.', 'There has been no sanctioned boxing in the UK since March, however, and it is difficult to gauge if fans will warm to a promotion with only the televised echo of leather on skin for atmosphere.', 'Bookmakers, meanwhile, weighed in quickly on a Fury-Joshua match-up. William Hill did not hesitate to make Fury a 2-1 on favourite, with Joshua at 6-4. Their boxing spokesperson, Rupert Adams, said, “Tyson was so dominant against Wilder that we feel we have to make him the favourite to go on and beat Joshua.” Paddy Power have Fury at 7-4 on and Joshua at 11-8, which seems about right. ', 'As for the venue, the Irish bookmakers think Hearn will take the fight back to Saudi Arabia, where Joshua beat Ruiz, and where there is much money available still in the coffers of the government’s “sportwashing” department.', 'Wherever it might end up – and Wembley would be a more acceptable venue for British fans – it is unlikely to be this year.

Liverpool’s mayor, Joe Anderson, thanked both clubs for making it clear to supporters that their presence at or near the ground would not be welcome.', 'Councillor Wendy Simon, the deputy mayor of Liverpool and chair of the council’s safety advisory group, said: “We are satisfied that the considerable evidence provided by the government, Everton and Liverpool football clubs, public health colleagues and Merseyside police will ensure that the outstanding fixtures for the Premier League season can be safely and securely played at both Goodison Park and Anfield.', '“A lot of factors have been taken into consideration, especially the safety of the players, match officials and staff. We are confident the measures in place will allow the matches to be held behind closed doors without detrimental impact. We would advise that everyone, wherever they may be watching these fixtures, strongly adhere to the guidance on social distancing.”With regard to the derby, which will be broadcast free to air, the Merseyside assistant chief constable, Rob Carden, said: “Working together with both teams, we want to ensure everyone enjoys the game from the safety of their own home. In relation to crime and disorder we have no objections to any of the home fixtures being played at their respective grounds, the main concern was always public health.', '“It is not the role of the police to make operational decisions on the basis of public health, we have been guided by experts and the government. We are still in unprecedented times and there are strong concerns in Merseyside and the wider north-west due to the fact the R-rate here is still higher than in the rest of the country. For that reason we would urge supporters to do the right thing – stay at home and keep your family, friends and neighbours safe.”', 'The supporters’ groups Blue Union and Spirit of Shankly were represented at the safety group meeting and welcomed the decision. A statement said: “Building on the magnificent community work both sets of fans have done throughout this pandemic, we are confident supporters will respect safety advice and avoid visiting stadia. We fully understand the importance of lockdown as a measure to control Covid-19 and would encourage fans to stay away.”', 'Everton have confirmed that Theo Walcott will miss the restart after undergoing abdominal surgery.

With club owners having voted this week to reduce the annual salary cap by £1.4m from 2021-22, putting an additional squeeze on squad wages, the RPA cannot rule out a walkout.\\xa0', '“We very much see it as the last action and something you would look to avoid for the benefit of all stakeholders, because it is an extreme move,” said Lambert, the long-serving Harlequins front-row forward.', '“But it is difficult for us to entirely rule out any options when we’re in the situation where we’ve got members with existing, fixed-term contracts essentially being strong-armed into thinking they have no choice but to sign an inferior contract.”', 'Lambert said Premiership Rugby’s desire to make permanent 25% wage cuts has been “unanimously rejected” by the players’ board and has warned of legal action. “From the outset of this crisis there has been an absolute disregard for the players and the values of the game,” he said.', '“Players at some clubs are now being served with ultimatums and being put under undue pressure to sign amended contracts through the manufactured deadline of 18 June.', '“To be clear, this is a totally unacceptable way to operate. Players are the lifeblood of the game and should be treated with respect. This latest situation could have been entirely avoided with a collaborative and transparent approach and we now find ourselves heading towards a significant legal dispute unless meaningful and genuine dialogue takes place urgently. In the meantime the RPA position remains unequivocal: the RPA is opposed to permanent cuts for our members.”', 'There is also disquiet that clubs are trying to force through pay cuts just months after collecting a £10m windfall apiece from the private equity firm CVC. Many clubs are still struggling to stay afloat financially and the RPA’s chief executive, Damian Hopley, said last month that his members were worried about the wider outlook for their sport.', '“We’ve been on calls to some clubs where there is a very genuine concern the club might not last the year based on the current financial projections,” Hopley said. “We don’t want to have a sport where there are only six clubs left at Christmas.”', 'Hopley is adamant that collective agreement is the best way forward. “Everyone recognises the world is a very different place to three months ago but the most important thing a player has is his contract.”', 'The Premiership season is to resume on 15 August, with the majority of players having started to return to training.']","Premiership","Sport","2020-06-10",13.08,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaac9b9425ed8b49b54819d4bf02cd658518f32e/0_37_4447_2668/master/4447.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8b6a919b2cbd0e3aac2c6756b1a3e401","Mark Lambert of Harlequins (centre) says ‘players are the lifeblood of the game and should be treated with respect’.

  ["Premier League restart preview No 6: Chelsea","['Frank Lampard will be desperate to hold on to a Champions League place and Kovacic, Pulisic and Loftus-Cheek should be back from injuries ']","['What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Frank Lampard had bristled when January passed without any arrivals at Stamford Bridge, warning that hopes of finishing in the top four were under threat. His concerns looked justified when his inconsistent side were beaten at home by Manchester United on 17 February. The most inexperienced manager in the league had seen frailties in attack and defence and although victory against Tottenham followed, Chelsea’s shortage of quality was hammered home when Bayern ran riot in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.', 'Yet there were positive signs. Kepa Arrizabalaga regained his spot in goal, while Olivier Giroud and Pedro started to fire in attack after injuries led to them being brought in from the cold. Then there was the impact of Billy Gilmour, who got his chance because of a selection crisis in midfield. The 18-year-old made a stunning impact in the victory against Liverpool in the FA Cup and his poise on the ball stood out when Chelsea, showing rare conviction in attack, tightened their grip on fourth place with a 4-0 thrashing of Everton on 8 March.', 'What about now? The break stalled Chelsea’s momentum but it has allowed injured players to return. Mateo Kovacic has shaken off a minor knock, Christian Pulisic is back from the adductor problem that has kept him out since 1 January and Ruben Loftus-Cheek will hopefully be ready to compete after recovering from an achilles injury. However it remains to be seen if N’Golo Kanté will be available after expressing health fears about coronavirus. Giroud and Willy Caballero have signed one-year contract extensions but Willian and Pedro could yet leave on free transfers on 30 June. Lampard will not want to lose them before the campaign is over – after all Chelsea will not have the RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner at their disposal until next season.', 'What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? With Werner close to joining for £53m, Hakim Ziyech due to arrive from Ajax and Lampard keen to sign Leicester’s Ben Chilwell, Chelsea cannot afford to miss out on Champions League qualification. The job is far from done, with Lampard’s side three points above fifth-placed Manchester United and five clear of Wolves and Sheffield United. Chelsea have often struggled to kill off teams, especially at home, and have shipped too many soft goals. They need to be more calm, more focused in defence and have greater precision in attack. For Lampard, the challenge is demonstrating he has used the time off to devise a more coherent tactical plan. Chelsea, who are also in the FA Cup quarter-finals, have let too many games spiral out of control.', 'Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? Callum Hudson-Odoi was reportedly arrested on the morning of 18 May and later released and bailed until mid-June. Mason Mount had to be reminded of his responsibilities after the midfielder was pictured having a kickabout with West Ham’s Declan Rice on 15 March.', 'Any unsung/community heroes? Chelsea\\xa0have played an active role in the community since the coronavirus outbreak. They\\xa0opened up the Millennium Hotel\\xa0on their Stamford Bridge stadium site to NHS staff \\xa0and teamed up with the domestic abuse charity Refuge to help provide support for people forced to self-isolate in vulnerable situations. The players also donated money to enable the Chelsea Foundation to help those in need during the crisis.', 'Key player in the run-in? Lampard will hope the deal for Werner will fire up Tammy Abraham, Chelsea’s top scorer. Abraham, who has struggled with an ankle injury this year, can link play and is smart inside the box. Chelsea need him to settle tight games.', 'End-of-season prediction Chelsea should have enough to qualify for the Champions League, especially if Manchester City’s ban means fifth place is enough, while their knockout prowess makes them a threat in the FA Cup. However they are unlikely to pull off a dramatic comeback when they play the second leg against Bayern in the Champions League.', 'Remaining fixtures (all times BST):\\xa0Sun 21 June Aston Villa (a) 4.15pm, Sky Sports Thur 25 June Manchester City (h) 8.15pm, Sky Sports Wed 1 July West Ham (a) 8.15pm, Sky Sports TBC Watford (h), Crystal Palace (a), Sheffield United (a), Norwich (h), Liverpool (a), Wolves (h).']","Football","Sport","2020-06-10",11.59,"Wed","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfb5352c491f0fa58b9c268aa863229ec311c5f3/0_241_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=55c6a10f84e150f7d44651e16f00e3b4","Chelsea’s Willian takes flight during training at Stamford Bridge.

Here comes everybody! Or at least, here come Kylian Mbappé, Ferran Torres, Ousmane Dembélé, Kalidou Koulibaly, Adama Traoré, Leroy Sané, Diego Carlos, Wout Weghorst, Talles Magno, Tanguy Ndombele, Thomas Partey, Bukayo Saka and Eduardo Camavinga. Time for a paragraph break?', 'And we go again, with Aster Vranckx, Nicolò Zaniolo, Dominik Szoboszlai, Victor Osimhen, Boubakary Soumaré, Willian, Philippe Coutinho, Marcelo Brozovic, Milot Rashica, Kostas Tsimikas, Marcus Thuram, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho.', 'What do these footballers have in common? All of them have been “linked with” a move to Liverpool. Even better, all of them have been linked with a move to Liverpool in the last two months, a list of suggested transactions that bears repeating only because it is so absurd. We can only hope for the sake of his own sleep patterns that Jürgen Klopp has turned off that Google alert on his phone.', 'There are of course significant caveats to this red-shirted shadow army. “Linked with” is weak gruel at the best of times, shorthand for hopeful agents and arm’s-length bluff. And of course lockdown does funny things to all of us. Right now there is an empty space where football should be, tended by an industry that still needs to produce content.', 'But there is also an edge of reality buried beneath the mound of bodies, a shiver of anxiety as Liverpool’s final step towards the league title looms closer. This is driven in part by the question of what comes next. Something is happening here. But what exactly?', 'The most recent near-miss isn’t on that list. This is of course Timo Werner, who may or may not reach an agreement with Chelsea this week, but who has already become a very public Liverpool non-signing. It is an interesting move in itself, failure to recruit a player presented by Klopp as an act rather than an omission, as a positive choice, another part of a commercially-sound team-building strategy.', 'At £53m Werner was simply the right man in the wrong moment of total economic collapse. Such is the level of trust in Klopp and the club’s owners that this seems pretty reasonable. Footballing lore insists that great teams always build from a position of strength: a line that tends to overlook the wider truth that, weak or strong, in football you always need to be building, that even the finest teams exist in a state of constant disintegration.', 'It is this point that some supporters feel most keenly. Liverpool are champions of Europe. Liverpool spent the first six months of the season marching the rest of the field around the Premier League in a headlock. Liverpool have the most resourceful elite-level manager in the world.', 'And yet, there is also an acceptance that a team built on coaching and chemistry is in need of some urgent refreshing. Werner is a high-class player. His arrival would have reflected the success of recent methods, where large amounts have been spent, but on the right players in just the right spot.', 'There is still time. A high-class central defender and a versatile attacker (plenty on that shadow list) are still wanted. But teams are also fragile things. Time is passing. How often do these moments come around, when every element of an organisation aligns on the same course, when a wider generational success can be seen bedding into place?', 'And how often does such a moment coincide with a wider economic collapse and a four-month pause in the workings of everyday life? Liverpool have, above all, been terribly unlucky with timing.', 'This misfortune applies to the recruitment cycle. The significant period of evolution for the current team was between summer 2017 and summer 2018. During that year Alisson, Fabinho, Andy Robertson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah all arrived, while Trent Alexander-Arnold emerged as a first-team player.', 'It has been a brilliant spell of team building. But by the time football returns it will be two years since Liverpool signed a significant player and 12 regular first-team squad members will be 28 or older. Alexander-Arnold is the only young player in the first XI. A period of renewal is due. Klopp knows this better than anyone. It was clearly coming this summer.', 'At which point: enter one global meltdown. The plans hatched to manage this will have been based on a previous version of reality, one in which it made sense to pay large amounts for a single high-class addition, and where commercial and TV income seemed guaranteed in perpetuity.', 'These are fragile margins, too. To reach this stage, to win the Champions League while also achieving record profits, is a wonderful achievement. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Success is a brittle thing. Imagine throwing a broken season plus total business model collapse into the workings of Manchester United 1992, Chelsea 2004 or Barcelona 2005. Success would still come. But earthquakes hardly help, not least ones that seem geared to attack specifically your own points of strength.', 'On the pitch the current Liverpool is built around extreme physicality and beautifully-grooved team chemistry, all of which have been interrupted. It is also a style built with the home crowd in mind, a way of playing that feeds on shared energy. Liverpool haven’t lost a significant domestic match at Anfield in over two years. This is all part of the design, formulated within parameters that have now disappeared. Same for everyone. But how many others had cracked it to this degree?', 'The commercial landscape has also changed. Liverpool became the best club team on the planet by playing the existing rules perfectly. Klopp and Fenway Sports Group have been kings of the FFP era, obeying the rules of engagement and exploiting their own resources better than anyone else at that level in Europe.', 'Well, say goodbye to all that. It is fairly clear that financial fair play will be given minimal policing from here as football looks to rake in every penny it can. A club like Chelsea is suddenly back in that position of power, with access to a bottomless set of pockets, and prepared to spend speculatively.', 'The game has changed. Will Liverpool change with it?', 'Not so far, and rightly so. Be true to thine own self: the most Klopp-era thing Liverpool could have done at a time of falling revenues, pay cuts and social division was to walk away from a £200,000-a-week new signing.', 'There will no doubt be money to spend. But success to date has arrived hand in hand with being able to read the room, and in this case the commercial management has once again followed its instincts. Who knows, in time Werner-to-Liverpool might turn out to be one of the great non-signings, an era-defining non-signing.

It shouldn’t take an Amnesty investigation for workers to be paid what they are owed.”', 'Amnesty also criticised Fifa for not doing more to put pressure on Qatar. “If, over the past 10 years, Fifa had held its World Cup partners to account, and used its clout to push Qatar to fully reform its systems, we wouldn’t be hearing the same tales of workers’ suffering with only two-and-a-half years until kick-off,” added Cockburn.', 'Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy told Amnesty that it first learned of QMC’s payment problems in July 2019 and had since taken various measures to try to remedy the situation , including meeting the company’s management, blacklisting it from future contracts and informing the Ministry of Labour.', 'Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3', 'However Amnesty said it was still unacceptable that many workers had gone from September 2019 to March 2020 without pay.', '“Although recent payments will provide some welcome relief for workers, Qatar’s World Cup organisers told us they had known about the salary delays since July 2019,” added Cockburn. “This raises the question of why Qatar allowed workers to continue working for months without pay.”', 'QMC told Amnesty the payment delays were due to financial difficulties and said it was trying to resolve them.']","World Cup 2022","Sport","2020-06-11",0.01,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15d514bb3ac4fbd7a2f072ad3eb2f4f5e74996d3/0_27_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=a449afd228e1ce2627a8d6a1170d6a90","The Al Bayt Stadium in Doha, Qatar has been described as one of the ‘crown jewels’ of the Qatar 2022 World Cup.

McIlroy cited his own idolisation of Tiger Woods as a reason why skin colour shouldn’t lead to the placement of barriers.', 'After a three-month absence triggered by coronavirus, the PGA Tour will restart with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas. It is the death of Floyd, rather than the pandemic, which feels most prominent on the landscape after demonstrations on both sides of the Atlantic. The Tour has initiated a moment of silence each day in Floyd’s memory and left the 8.46 tee time free, in reference to the period he was pinned to the ground by a policeman in Minneapolis.', '“A great word that I’ve sort of been thinking of over the last couple of weeks is ‘tolerance,’” said McIlroy. “I think everyone can just be a little more tolerant, and a little more educated and not as ignorant.', '“My hero growing up was Tiger Woods. Tiger doesn’t look the same as me, has had a very different upbringing to the one that I have had, but he was my hero growing up, and it didn’t matter what colour his skin was, what his beliefs were. Tiger was my hero, and he’s been a lot of kids’ heroes over the years that have grown up playing golf. We’ve been very lucky to have him in our game. I think that there should be more people like him in golf.”', 'McIlroy was struck by a conversation, filmed in recent days, between Harold Varner and the PGA Tour’s commissioner Jay Monahan. Varner is one of a tiny number of black PGA Tour members. “These issues I think really hit home with me,” McIlroy explained. “Harold said, it maybe just isn’t about the players, it’s about everyone in the game of golf. There’s so many people that are involved with the game, and as long as we continue to give people from different backgrounds opportunities to be in golf, that can only be a good thing.”', 'Woods called last week for a “safer, unified society” on account of the “shocking tragedy” of Floyd. The 15-times major winner is not in the Charles Schwab field but speculation suggests he may feature next week when the PGA Tour reaches South Carolina.', 'McIlroy, who reiterated his belief that a world circuit in golf would be beneficial, praised the PGA Tour for “robust” Covid-19 procedures. “It has felt very safe,” said the Northern Irishman. “Everyone is doing the right things, and the people that are involved with the tournament are wearing masks and wearing gloves and there’s sanitiser everywhere you look. It feels safe. I feel safe, and I would say basically everyone else that’s here feels the same way.', '“I think it’s an important week because golf can show that we can play in a socially distant manner. We can conduct a tournament and adhere to all the safety protocols that have been put in place.“It is going to be very easy to fall back into old habits because it’s just what we’ve done. I’d say for the viewing public just to give the players and the caddies a little bit of leeway in terms of if they see something on TV that isn’t quite right. We’re having to figure it out as we go along, as well.

  ["BT Sport reveals plans to tackle fan-free TV football spectacle","['Artificial crowd noise and fans in studios planned', '‘We believe that crowds are what hold sports together’']","['The head of BT Sport has said games behind closed doors will give broadcasters an opportunity to innovate despite accepting the spectacle will have something missing when the Premier League season resumes without fans on 17 June.', 'BT will attempt to enhance the viewing experience with artificial crowd noise and plans to build a sense of community by having supporters in studios, but Simon Green admitted the product was not the same in empty stadiums.', '“It absolutely matters that the event is shown in the best way it can be shown,” he said. “Sport as a spectacle is far better with an atmosphere and a crowd. But at the moment we all understand that’s not possible. It’s a temporary thing and hopefully it won’t last too long. The demand for the sport is there. We want to be able to provide it in the best way possible.”', 'Green said audiences had reacted positively since BT added crowd noise to its live coverage of Bundesliga matches and added that Premier League fans would be given the chance to switch the feature off during games.', '“I was surprised by how well received it was by our viewers, particularly on social media, and some of the feedback we’ve had from the press and radio as well,” Green said. “We are stepping forward and next weekend, after working with the Premier League and EA Sports, crowd noise will be offered as standard, with the ability for anybody who doesn’t want it to take it away. The option will be to remove it rather than to step into it.', '“We believe that crowds are what hold sports together. We are looking at how to bring live fans into the coverage in a very restrictive and intimate way in some capacity across the studio coverage, whether it be the early kick-off before the first game we show next Saturday or in our post-match show.”', 'Green, who said BT had been hit financially during the coronavirus pandemic, is confident fans will watch games in empty stadiums. “It does impact us but there is an intrigue to it,” he said. “We’re working with the Premier League, we’ve worked with the Bundesliga and we’ve seen the effect of not having crowds.', '“The viewing figures for the Bundesliga, the averages even now are well up prior to what they were before Covid. It’s the only live football at the moment but there does seem to be a genuine interest in watching live sport, with or without crowds.', '“Having watched the Bundesliga we are all acutely aware it’s not quite the product it was previously. But the emotional interest and attachment people have to football in this country is such that it will still be a very strong television product. Without crowds it does open up opportunities to use innovation to enhance coverage.”', 'BT’s first game will be Watford v Leicester on 20 June.']","Premier League","Sport","2020-06-11",18.58,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77cccd5ae7dd5d1871a88179dd3e69a33103f599/0_76_7205_4322/master/7205.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=1a065dd5b7e6a00e4868232abe47a686","BT Sport plans to enhance the viewing experience with artificial crowd noise when showing matches without fans.

Why is it a disadvantage to be black in this country? Why are there not enough coaches and managers that are black in football? We have to understand the historical context and educate ourselves around that in order to understand today and the context we face now.”', 'Meanwhile, new Fifa regulations will allow leagues to open transfer windows before this season is concluded, though the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, has said its clubs will not be able to sign players before 25 July, after the campaign is brought to an end.']","Premier League","Sport","2020-06-11",15.48,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d1e2e7e386df768812467029cd41e806e283a64/0_285_5070_3044/master/5070.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=8cd039a069b4183fb3785cee166f51cb","Arsenal’s Sead Kolasinac, Nicolas Pépé, Matteo Guendouzi and Alexandre Lacazette take a knee before a friendly against Brentford on Wednesday.

  ["Mourinho rues poor Tottenham start as Rodgers hails 'amazing' Leicester","['Spurs manager angry at ‘empty spots’ in first 20 minutes', 'Rodgers happy at ‘outstanding’ performance and strategy']","['José Mourinho criticised the attitude of his Tottenham players at the opening whistle against Leicester in a game they lost 2-0 to dent their hopes of closing back on Liverpool at the top of the Premier League table.', 'The Spurs manager saw Serge Aurier concede a reckless 45th-minute penalty, which Jamie Vardy converted to put Leicester in control. The second goal came when Toby Alderweireld turned a Vardy header into his own net, meaning that Spurs have lost two and drawn one of their past three fixtures. It was Leicester who jumped up into second place – four points behind Liverpool.', '“We started bad,” Mourinho said. “The first 20 minutes was a poor performance, some empty spots in terms of pressing, attitude, recovering the ball. I didn’t like [it] at all. The fact we didn’t start well is not because I didn’t tell them to start well. I didn’t tell them: ‘Don’t be proactive or be reactive.’ But I admit we did start bad.', '“We changed during the first half, adapting the positions in midfield. We improved a lot, had a period of domination and then the penalty. The penalty is not a penalty created, it’s a penalty that we commit. For me, iIt was out of context to the game at that moment because it was our best period. Aurier made a mistake. But before his mistake we had other players making mistakes in other areas of the pitch. I can’t blame a player for a mistake.”', 'Brendan Rodgers described Leicester’s performance as “outstanding”, strategically “amazing” and the victory as “thoroughly deserved”. Mourinho did not agree. “It is a game we lost on a penalty and an own goal and the result looks like the opponents were totally in control or better than us, but that is not the reality,” he said. “Our performance was not good but the game was not like they deserved to win or we deserved to lose. It was not a good game.”']","Premier League","Sport","2020-12-20",20.24,"Sun","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de641825f898ec5a328090637984d3d85b26c20/0_0_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=0ab253cfdc119d1affb1928277e9de06","An exasperated José Mourinho during Spurs’ home defeat to Leicester.

But on the issue of extra substitutes, described by the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, as one of “player welfare and mental health”, the vote was split down the middle.', 'Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leicester, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield United, West Ham and Wolves voted to stick to the maximum of three changes per team. The league did, however, agree to extend the number of listed substitutes from seven per team to nine.', 'As a result the English top flight remains the only major league in Europe not to have expanded the number of substitutes in a season heavily compacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. It also stands alone in England, with the EFL and FA Cup having increased their substitute numbers.', 'Private anger is spreading among top clubs who believe the chance to change has passed without a case for keeping the rules having been made publicly.', 'It is understood that whereas Manchester City and Liverpool made the case for a rule change during the shareholders’ meeting, no counter-argument was presented. It is widely held, however, that clubs reluctant to adjust the rules feel any change would embed a competitive advantage for those clubs with deeper squads.', 'The likelihood is the “nays” knew they had enough votes to prevail. Any motion must carry 14 shareholder votes to enter the Premier League rulebook. Despite a recent meeting of top-flight managers suggesting that as many as 15 wanted change, it had become clear before Thursday’s meeting that some were unable to carry their clubs with them. David Moyes, for example, has said he changed his opinion and would consider allowing five substitutions but West Ham voted against it.', 'In other items of business at the meeting, the league chose to follow the FA in endorsing the use of concussion substitutes. In a trial that could begin as early as next month a team may make up to two permanent substitutions per match to protect players suspected of suffering concussion. In the event of one team making such a change, the opposition will be granted an extra substitution.', 'Shareholders also voted in favour of extending the league’s broadcast deal with beIN Sports in the Middle East and north Africa until 2025. Valued at $500m (£368m), it replicates the terms of the previous contract and will provide a boost to the league in the week French clubs turned to the government for emergency funding after the collapse of a TV deal.']","Premier League","Sport","2020-12-17",16.55,"Thu","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29448b095e55570bd6d485c89fa48e2b6ba88af8/0_171_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620&quality=85&fit=max&s=4b86555bbaaefe5e05d760a36c53b70d","Jürgen Klopp prepares to bring on four substitutes during Liverpool’s Champions League game at home to Atalanta in November.
